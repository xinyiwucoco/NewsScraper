into turmoil, the officials said. turkey\u2019s currency has plunged amid the crisis amid fears that the u.s. could take tougher steps before the standoff is resolved.the trump administration is now positioned to impose new penalties on turkey for refusing to free andrew brunson, an evangelical north carolina pastor who was detained in turkey as part of a sweeping crackdown after a failed july 2016 coup.mr. brunson\u2019s fate has become the most polarizing issue dividing the u.s. and turkey, two north atlantic treaty organization members that have repeatedly clashed over washington\u2019s policy in the middle east.mr. brunson, who ran a small protestant church for more than two decades on turkey\u2019s aegean coast, was detained in october 2016 and eventually accused of terrorism and espionage, charges that could send him to turkish prison for 35 years.the trump administration has dismissed the case as groundless, and mr. brunson has denied the charges. his freedom has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for evangelical christians in the u.s. he is represented by jay sekulow, one of president trump\u2019s top attorneys, who made sure the issue had white house attention. vice president mike pence has also championed mr. brunson\u2019s case.the trump administration thought it had an agreement last month to free mr. brunson when he appeared for a court hearing. when the judge instead sent mr. brunson back to prison, u.s. officials said they were stunned.mr. trump denounced the action on twitter as a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and urged turkish president recep tayyip erdogan to set mr. brunson free.after a week of tense talks, u.s. officials again expected mr. brunson to be sent back to the u.s. in late july. but he was instead placed under house arrest at his home in the port city of izmir.that move proved to be a catalyst in washington for those looking to put more pressure on ankara. congress quickly moved to block plans to sell turkey up to 100 of america\u2019s advanced f-35 jet fighter.last week, the trump administration accused turkey\u2019s justice and interior ministers of human rights abuses and imposed economic sanctions on both men. the crisis sent turkey\u2019s lira plunging to record lows. publicly, mr. erdogan was defiant. privately, his government was trying to secure a face-saving way to end the standoff.on monday, turkey\u2019s currency plunged again after the u.s. said it was considering new penalties against ankara as the two countries battle over economic tariffs.on tuesday, turkish officials said they had reached a preliminary agreement with the u.s. and sent a high-level delegation to washington.hopes rose again in washington that mr. brunson would be freed imminently.on wednesday, turkish deputy foreign minister sedat onal met with officials at the departments of state and treasury to discuss the dispute. but the talks ended without any assurances about mr. brunson, u.s. officials said.the breakdown makes it more likely that the trump administration will take new punitive steps against turkey, such as imposing sanctions on other turkish leaders, the officials said.along with freedom from mr. brunson, the u.s. has been working to secure release for a turkish-american nasa scientist, serkan golge, who was also arrested in the post-coup crackdown in turkey, and three turkish citizens who

"article": "new york moved to become the first city in the u.s. to cap ride-hailing services including uber technologies inc. and lyft inc., freezing new vehicle licenses for one year while it studies the fallout from the booming industry. the vote wednesday by the new york city council could cripple the growth of uber and lyft in their biggest u.s. market as both companies are heading toward eventual initial public offerings. the silicon valley companies\u2019 businesses depend on recruiting as many drivers as they can to drive down fares and cut pickup times. council members approved a package of bills after months of campaigning from taxi drivers and others in favor of the legislation and a challenge by the ride-hailing companies urging customers to oppose the bills. mayor bill de blasio, who has championed the measures and unsuccessfully tried to rein in the services in 2015, said he would sign the legislation. \u201cour city is directly confronting a crisis that is driving working new yorkers into poverty and our streets into gridlock,\u201d he said.the ride-hailing firms warned that the cap, which the council approved in a 39-6 vote, would lead to reduced service in the outer boroughs and to higher fares at a time when the city\u2019s subway and bus systems are frequently delayed and overcrowded. \u201cthe city\u2019s 12-month pause on new vehicle licenses will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion,\u201d a spokeswoman for uber, danielle filson, said. ms. filson added: \u201cuber will do whatever it takes to keep up with growing demand.\u201d joseph okpaku, vice president of public policy for lyft, said: \u201cthese sweeping cuts to transportation will bring new yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of color and in the outer boroughs.\u201dthe vote marks the first big lobbying setback for uber ceo dara khosrowshahi. since joining the company in september from expedia group inc., mr. khosrowshahi has scored several wins, including a short reprieve in london after regulators there threatened to effectively shutter uber. he also helped to soften legislation affecting ride-hail drivers in brazil. uber\u2019s fate in new york carries added weight as the company eyes an ipo in the second half of next year. if other cities follow new york\u2019s example, it could cast doubt on uber\u2019s ability to maintain its growth, as well as the effectiveness of its lobbying operation. the nine-year-old company, last valued by investors at about $70 billion, recorded more than $7 billion in revenue last year but lost $4.5 billion.ride-hailing companies have altered the way new yorkers get around the city. subway and bus ridership is falling despite a growing population and rising employment in new york. the metropolitan transportation authority, which runs the systems, says ridership is falling most steeply in parts of the outer boroughs and during off-peak hours\u2014times and places where ride-hailing is growing fastest.the taxi and livery companies are a powerful force in new york. the value of a yellow taxi medallion has plummeted from more than $1 million a few years ago to less than $200,000 today.uber and lyft, which dominate the market in new york, have expanded rapidly. in 2015, 25,000 ride-hailing vehicles were licensed in the city. today, there are about 80,000 such vehicles. their growth has come at a time of rising congestion on the city\u2019s streets and of falling wages for taxi, livery and black-car drivers. there are about 13,500 yellow cabs in the city and about 32,000 livery and traditional black cars. bruce schaller, a transportation analyst who has studied app-based ride-hailing, said on some new york city streets uber and lyft vehicles contribute to at least 50% of traffic.new york is unique because it issues licenses to uber drivers, allowing the taxi and limousine commission to more closely monitor ride-hailing firms. as a result, new york\u2019s uber and lyft drivers tend to be professionals, many of whom used to drive yellow cabs. in other cities, just about anyone with access to a vehicle who passes a background check can drive for uber.the council also voted to allow the city to set a minimum hourly wage for ride-hail drivers. the companies would be required to fill in the gap if drivers don\u2019t meet the threshold.uber has said it supports congestion pricing to help ease traffic in new york and would work with the city on setting terms.some cities, including boston, have reached agreements with uber and lyft for more disclosure about the numbers of rides they complete or other data, though they generally have little oversight of their operations beyond taxation and certain safety measures. during the cap on new vehicles, the taxi and limousine commission will study whether to regulate the number of licenses in the city and where those vehicles can operate. other bills passed by the council create a new class of for-hire vehicle that can be independently regulated and a minimum payment for drivers. standing inside city hall\u2019s rotunda on wednesday, mohammad tipu sultan, a 43-year-old cabdriver from brooklyn, welcomed the vote. \u201cthis is the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cthe fight is not over.\u201d write to paul

o\u2019connor\u2019s performance in a district mr. trump carried by 11 percentage points. in 2016, gop rep. pat tiberi won re-election in the same district by 36 points. mr. tiberi subsequently resigned to take a job leading an ohio business group, prompting the special election.according to an analysis from the cook political report wednesday, there are 68 gop-held seats that are less solidly republican than the ohio 12th. democrats must net 23 seats to gain control of the house in november.\u201cto be so close and not pull it out is disappointing, but the reality is we shouldn\u2019t have been in the game,\u201d said rep. tim ryan (d., ohio). \u201ci think this result is a canary in the coal mine for the republicans.\u201ddemocrats involved in mr. o\u2019connor\u2019s race said mr. trump\u2019s saturday night rally helped drive up republican turnout for mr. balderson. gop leaders, though, cautioned that the president may not be able to repeat that performance in dozens of congressional districts, nor will they be able to sink millions into every contested seat.the president\u2019s impact elsewhere was less clear. in kansas, mr. trump intervened on the eve of the governor\u2019s primary, with a twitter endorsement of secretary of state kris kobach against incumbent gov. jeff colyer, who ascended to the post when his predecessor, sam brownback, resigned to become an ambassador in the trump administration.the race was tied in pre-primary surveys, and remained virtually deadlocked, with mr. kobach ahead by 200 votes out of more than 311,000 cast.the associated press has yet to declare a winner in the ohio house race or the kansas gop gubernatorial primary. each may require a recount due to the narrow margins of victory.mr. kobach was a trump favorite long before the president tweeted his support. he had served as an immigration adviser for the trump campaign and had led the since-disbanded presidential commission tasked with investigating the president\u2019s unproven claim that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. mr. kobach also claimed there was rampant voter fraud in the election, although his commission produced no evidence to back that up. donald trump jr. campaigned for mr. kobach, who highlighted his connection with the president in his tv ads. stephanie clayton, a kansas state house republican who was neutral in tuesday\u2019s primary, said the value of mr. trump\u2019s endorsement was minimal because voters already knew mr. kobach was close to mr. trump.\u201ckansans have known that kobach was trump\u2019s guy for a long time, for years,\u201d she said. \u201cso the trump endorsement, i really don\u2019t think put things over the top.\u201dtuesday held other warning signs for the gop.in washington state, rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers, the house conference\u2019s fourth-ranking member, appeared to have won less than 50% against a field of challengers. the top two vote-getters in the open primary will face off in november.washington, which conducts its elections entirely by mail, had counted only about two-thirds of its votes by late wednesday because other ballots haven\u2019t yet been received by election officials.the ohio results were especially troubling for the gop given mr. o\u2019connor\u2019s strength in the columbus suburbs, long a republican stronghold before mr. trump\u2019s emergence as the party standard-bearer.in southwest ohio, gop rep. steve chabot\u2019s district, which backed mr. trump by 6 percentage points, is a similar mix of urban, suburban and rural areas.the 11-term incumbent faces a challenge from aftab pureval, a democrat who is the elected clerk of courts in hamilton county, which includes cincinnati.despite his congressional seniority, mr. chabot has raised just $383,000 in 2018, a fraction of mr. pureval\u2019s $1.6 million, according to federal election commission disclosure reports.\u201cit\u2019s not surprising when you look at the energy and activism in our state,\u201d said mr. pureval. \u201cwe\u2019re seeing it in cincinnati every day.\u201dmr. chabot, in a campaign blog post wednesday, said tuesday\u2019s results won\u2019t mean much for his re-election bid. he predicted the november electorate will look more like those from 2010 and 2014, when republicans dominated, rather than a special election in august.\u201cso what does this race mean for the upcoming midterm elections? not all that much in my humble opinion,\u201d he wrote. \u201calthough it\u2019s clear that the liberal base is energized this time around, principally because they hate trump so much.\u201drepublicans are certain to continue to deploy the anti-pelosi playbook they used against mr. o\u2019connor. mr. balderson\u2019s

participating in an insider-trading scheme to sell the shares of an australian biotechnology company before the public disclosure of a failed drug trial.federal prosecutors in manhattan accused rep. collins, 68 years old, of tipping off his son last summer about the results of a multiple-sclerosis drug trial completed by innate immunotherapeutics ltd. , a biotechnology company based in sydney. rep. collins was a member of innate\u2019s board of directors and one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders, holding approximately 16.8% of its stock, the indictment said. rep. collins, who serves the 27th district in western new york near buffalo and rochester, was the first member of congress to endorse donald trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. once considered a backbencher in the house, rep. collins\u2019s stature grew after mr. trump won the gop nomination.according to the indictment, rep. collins passed the confidential results to his son, cameron collins, so he could trade on the tip. prosecutors say his son sold nearly 1.4 million innate shares and gave the information to at least four individuals, including his fianc\u00e9e and her father, stephen zarsky. mr. zarsky then sold all of his innate shares and shared the tip with at least three other individuals, including his brother and sister, before the public release of the trial results, according to the indictment. \ufeff\ufefftom price, the former secretary of health and human services, was also an investor in innate and has previously said he bought shares in the company after hearing about it from rep. collins. dr. price sold his innate shares upon taking the cabinet post and wasn\u2019t a shareholder in june 2017 when the clinical-trial results were announced. several other republicans in congress held stock in the company, according to financial disclosures. innate publicly announced the failed drug trial after u.s. markets had closed on june 26, 2017. the next day, innate\u2019s stock dropped more than 90%. in total, the trades allowed the defendants and alleged co-conspirators to avoid more than $768,000 in losses, the indictment said. \u201ci believe i acted properly and within the law at all times,\u201d rep. collins said at a press conference wednesday night, saying he had also followed \u201call rules and ethical guidelines\u201d for members of congress. he said he would remain on the ballot in november, running for re-election.cameron collins and mr. zarsky were also charged wednesday. their lawyers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.all three men pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in manhattan federal court, and each was released on $500,000 bond.innate\u2019s primary business has been developing an experimental drug to treat an advanced form of multiple sclerosis, the subject of the failed clinical trial. the company\u2019s chief executive told investors in 2016 that its future would depend on the drug\u2019s success. rep. collins has been an investor in the company for more than 15 years, the wall street journal previously reported.on wednesday, house speaker paul ryan (r., wis.) removed rep. collins from his perch on the powerful house energy and commerce committee and called on the bipartisan house ethics committee to investigate the lawmaker\u2019s conduct.four days before the public release of the drug clinical-trial results, innate\u2019s chief executive sent an email to the company\u2019s board saying the trial had failed, the indictment said. rep. collins, who was attending the congressional picnic at the white house, allegedly responded to the email: \u201cwow. makes no sense. how are these results even possible??\u201d less than a minute later, prosecutors said, he made multiple calls to his son.his son and his fianc\u00e9e, who is identified only as \u201cco-conspirator 1\u201d in the indictment, then drove to the home of her father, mr. zarsky, to alert them of the results, prompting mr. zarsky and his wife to sell all of their innate shares, prosecutors said. the next morning, mr. zarsky allegedly disseminated the trial results to others, including calling his sister to tell her she \u201cneeded to sell her innate shares and not to ask why,\u201d the indictment said.the three men were charged with 10 criminal counts, including securities fraud, wire fraud and making false statements during interviews with the federal bureau of investigation. the securities and exchange commission also sued rep. collins, his son and mr. zarsky in a civil action filed in manhattan federal court. prosecutors said rep. collins didn\u2019t make any trades himself. at the time he found out about innate\u2019s failed drug trial, he was already being investigated for his promotion of the biotech company by the office of congressional ethics, a nonpartisan body that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by members of congress. according to the congressman\u2019s 2016 financial disclosure report, he held a stake in innate valued at the time between $25 million and $50 million. other republican lawmakers\u2014including rep. markwayne mullin of oklahoma, rep. john culberson of texas, and rep. mike conaway of texas\u2014have also purchased stakes in the company, according to financial disclosures. rep. mullin still owns the stock, a spokeswoman said. rep. culberson has previously said he sold his stake in the company on june 12, 2017, which is 10 days before rep. collins allegedly shared the drug trial results with his son. he said he sold \u201csimply to cut my losses,\u201d according to a statement.rep. conaway sold his stock in november 2017, a spokeswoman said.in october, the oce issued a report saying rep. collins used his public office to benefit innate and may have shared nonpublic information with other investors. the office referred the case to the house ethics committee and said the conduct may have violated federal law. the house ethics committee, which is evenly divided between republican and democratic members of congress, has an ongoing investigation into rep. collins, but it hasn\u2019t set up an investigative subcommittee to look into the allegations.the arrest of rep. collins will likely tighten his re-election campaign fending off democratic challenger nate mcmurray, the town supervisor of grand island. the nonpartisan cook political report on wednesday changed its rating of the district, moving it to \u201clikely republican\u201d from \u201csolid republican.\u201d republicans still hold an advantage in the district, which mr. trump won with more than 59% of the vote in 2016. and mr. mcmurray had less than $82,000 in cash on hand at the end of june, compared with rep. collins\u2019s $1.3 million in cash on hand at the same point, according to federal election commission records.\u201cthese are very serious charges,\u201d said matt gorman, spokesman for house republicans\u2019 campaign arm. \u201cwe will let the facts come to light and trust the judicial system as we continue to assess his reelection campaign.\u201d write to nicole hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com and kristina peterson at

$9 million\u2014flowed from mr. manafort\u2019s offshore accounts to u.s.-based vendors ranging from landscapers to high-end tailors.about $6.7 million of the offshore money was used to pay for personal real estate in new york and virginia, according to the agent.none of those payments, either to vendors or for property, was business related, mr. welch testified, and should have been reported as income on mr. manafort\u2019s tax returns.mr. welch also testified that mr. manafort failed to tell the internal revenue service he held and controlled foreign bank accounts.testimony from mr. welch, and from an fbi accountant earlier in the day, are critical pieces of the case being presented by special counsel robert mueller\u2019s office. mr. manafort has been indicted on charges of lying on his taxes, hiding offshore accounts and defrauding banks. most of the charges predate his work in 2016 as chairman for trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and aren\u2019t directly related to the focus of mr. mueller\u2019s investigation: russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential campaigns.mr. welch\u2019s testimony followed that of an fbi agent, morgan magionos, who is a forensic accountant. ms. magionos testified she was able to identify about $60 million that flowed from ukrainian businessmen to mr. manafort\u2019s offshore accounts from 2010 through 2014. mr. manafort consulted for ukranian politicians, including the country\u2019s former president, during that time frame.in cross-examination, mr. manafort\u2019s legal team pressed the agents on discrepancies in the records and other accepted accounting methods that could potentially explain mr. manafort\u2019s financial transactions.one defense lawyer questioned the fbi accountant on whether she had investigated the applications for opening the cypriot bank accounts themselves, highlighting how certain signatures that purported to be mr. manafort\u2019s didn\u2019t resemble his signature on loan applications seized from his home.in questioning the irs agent, another lawyer for mr. manafort focused on an accounting method that allows taxpayers to spread out income from multiyear contracts, and raised the complicated nature tax laws related to partnerships, in what appeared to be an effort to explain mr. manafort\u2019s transactions as a product of complicated regulations and accounting methods.the testimony, though technical, followed the dramatic appearance of rick gates, a former associate and employee of mr. manafort\u2019s who pleaded guilty in the case and took the witness stand on behalf of prosecutors. he admitted over three days of testimony to conspiring to help mr. manafort cheat on his taxes, hide the existence of the offshore accounts and to defraud banks.mr. gates told jurors he had taken responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in a deal with mr. mueller\u2019s office.\u201ci made many mistakes over many years,\u201d mr. gates told jurors in response to a question from mr. manafort\u2019s lawyer, kevin downing.mr. downing spent most of his cross-examination assailing mr. gates\u2019s credibility, noting he pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents and embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from mr. manafort.at the end of trial on wednesday, prosecutor greg andres said the government had eight witnesses left to question for an hour or less each, and expected to end their case by friday. write to del quentin wilber at del.wilber@wsj.com and aruna viswanatha at aruna.viswanatha@wsj.com", "summaryGensim":

crude oil and fuels such as gasoline, which rose by 3.3 million barrels, to 1.21 billion barrels, the highest since early january. that is bearish for prices, because it suggests demand isn\u2019t

oil production, to 10.8 million barrels a day, from 10.9 million a week earlier. this suggests that logistical problems in texas, including a lack of sufficient pipelines, are forcing oil producers to tap the brakes on output until they can improve infrastructure. an intensifying trade fight between the u.s. and china over tariffs also pressured oil prices. on wednesday, china\u2019s commerce ministry, in a retaliatory move, said it would impose 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion in u.s. imports, matching u.s. tariffs on china goods dollar-for-dollar. the tariffs will go into effect on aug. 23, the same date as the u.s. ones. these trade tensions can push oil prices lower in two ways. investors worry that a potential global trade war could ensue, leading to softer economic growth throughout the world and possibly reducing demand for oil. also, the ratcheting-up of tensions has been sending investors into haven assets such as the u.s. dollar, and since oil is bought and sold in greenbacks, a stronger currency tends to weaken oil prices. \u201cheadlines on trade duty implementation specifics from the u.s. and china look to have added to downside in oil,\u201d said analysts at

levels\u201d of noncompliance with anti-money-laundering rules, according to a copy reviewed by the wall street journal. the royal canadian mounted police estimated in 2011, the latest year for which data is available, that between 5 billion and 15 billion canadian dollars ($3.8 billion to $11.5 billion) is laundered in the country every year. canada has five of the world\u2019s largest 60 banks and is an increasing destination for global capital. so what happens within the country has effects beyond its borders, according to anti-money-laundering specialists and regulators.yet critics say

laundering seriously. a spokesman added that lawmakers are reviewing ways to strengthen the detection and deterrence of money laundering, and are expected to issue recommendations in the fall.canada logs few money-laundering convictions compared with its peers. from 2000 to 2016, canada recorded convictions in 316 cases on charges related to money laundering, according to statistics canada. last year alone, u.k. prosecutors notched up 1,435 convictions where the main offense was money laundering. authorities in other countries are often the ones to act. in 2016, the u.s. treasury designated vancouver-based pacnet group as a significant transnational criminal organization laundering funds from global mail fraud. pacnet, a financial-services firm, denied the accusations but ceased business activities. \u201cif ultimately canadian authorities can be encouraged to crack down more on operations like pacnet that would be a wonderful thing,\u201d said steve st. clair, a former assistant

comment.critics of canada\u2019s approach to money laundering say several factors stymie attempts to crack down. these include strict privacy laws that make it difficult to get warrants, a reluctance to prosecute and the failure in some cases of banks to report suspicious transactions.\u201cwhat i saw was various banks underestimating the amount of work, resources and time that they would have to spend to deal with the [money-laundering] risks,\u201d said nicolas burbidge, who until 2016 led the compliance division of canada\u2019s main financial regulator, office of the superintendent of financial institutions. money-laundering specialists say regulators shoulder responsibility, too, claiming they don\u2019t take a tough enough stance, or in some cases lack powers to act. for example, osfi can\u2019t fine banks.fintrac has the authority to fine but uses the power sparingly. since december 2008 it has levied 95 penalties, raising around 3.5 million canadian dollars ($2.7 million). that compares with around $28 billion in fines the u.s. has issued for money-laundering related offenses since 2008, and $409 million the u.k. has. even when regulators spot problems, action isn\u2019t always taken. in a 2011 letter to bank of montreal, osfi concluded the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering and antiterror finance program \u201cis not where it needs to be to meet\u2026regulatory requirements, and is still lagging behind its peers,\u201d according to a copy reviewed by the journal.u.s. authorities alleged lapses, too: in 2013, the office of the comptroller of the currency publicly announced it had found \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d at bmo\u2019s anti-money-laundering compliance program.osfi said in an email it works with management and boards to correct problems. a bmo spokesman declined to comment on the letters but said the bank maintains rigorous anti-money- laundering controls.in 2009, osfi alerted canadian imperial bank of commerce to deficiencies in its efforts to monitor money laundering and terror finance. two years later, the regulator said the deficiencies were \u201cunacceptable,\u201d according to a copy of the 2013 letter reviewed by the journal.the bank received at least another two critical supervisory letters, including one as recently as last year, according to people familiar with the matter. cibc

framework announced wednesday divvies up sales-tax money among senior and junior holders of revenue bonds known as cofinas, the u.s. territory\u2019s largest single debt obligation.the agreement, which requires court approval, would mark the largest consensual debt settlement negotiated with creditors since puerto rico entered a court-supervised bankruptcy last year. the cofina debt stack would be slashed by 32%, saving puerto rico $17.5 billion in payments to bondholders compared with what they are currently owed.senior creditors would receive 93% of their claims in the form of new debt while junior holders would recover 56.4%. overall recoveries across both cofina debt classes total 74.5%, according to the settlement terms.puerto rico\u2019s federal oversight board supports the agreement, as do the largest mutual funds, bond insurers and hedge funds with claims against cofina revenues, which are sales taxes collected by merchants on the island.puerto rico gov. ricardo rossell\u00f3, who is tangling with the oversight board over pension cuts and other austerity measures, also endorsed the terms.\u201cthis agreement represents a significant step in restructuring puerto rico\u2019s debt and reaffirms once again the credibility of our efforts,\u201d the governor said.the oversight board\u2019s executive director, natalie jaresko, said it would present a restructuring plan by september to the judge presiding over puerto rico\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. after creditors vote on the plan, it could be approved by the end of the year, she said.the deal fits within a previous framework that roughly halves the amount of sales taxes available for cofina creditors and redirects the remainder to puerto rico\u2019s central government to pay other expenses.cofina creditors retained just over 53% of the future pledged revenues, plus more than $1 billion in sales-tax money collected during the current fiscal year and placed in escrow.puerto rico pledged sales-tax revenues to a cofina public corporation a decade ago to back new bonds that bridged deficits and raised financing at attractive interest rates. the bonds proved popular, especially among local investors, after puerto rico gave assurances that they would be paid from a dedicated revenue stream.but puerto rico\u2019s constitution stipulates that its separate general obligation bonds have first dibs on available government resources, raising doubt as to whether the cofina bonds were truly ironclad.aurelius capital management lp and other general obligation bondholders fought in the bankruptcy proceeding to wrest the pledged monies away from cofina bondholders. court-appointed negotiators agreed to split the revenues instead of having the courts decide who owns them.the settlement terms announced wednesday allow senior and junior cofina bondholders to exchange their claims for a single class of new securities. puerto rico could issue new subordinated debt in the future using the same sales-tax structure, ms. jaresko said.she said local retail bondholders could collect a sweetener for their participation in the deal, a 2% fee designed to mitigate the impact to puerto rico\u2019s economy from the reduced debt payments.the recoveries are a boon to whitebox advisors llc and other hedge funds that bought cofina bonds cheaply before gov. rossell\u00f3 took office and then stocked up again when hurricane maria devastated puerto rico last year, taking advantage of depressed debt prices.meanwhile the governor and the oversight board continue to fight over

tuesday that the going-private transaction was all but certain, with only a shareholder vote needed to pull it off, the people said. the sec\u2019s inquiries, which originated from the agency\u2019s san francisco office, suggest tesla could come under an enforcement investigation if regulators suspect that mr. musk\u2019s statement was misleading or false. it couldn\u2019t be learned on wednesday whether the agency had opened a formal enforcement investigation. an sec spokesman declined to comment. tesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.under u.s. law, companies and corporate officers can\u2019t give shareholders misleading information about meaningful company events. mr. musk also could be in trouble if regulators develop evidence that he made a statement aimed at goosing

stock\u2019s trading price earlier that day and 11% higher than its tuesday closing price. in his tweet tuesday afternoon, mr. musk wrote that the buyout had \u201cfunding secured,\u201d but he didn\u2019t provide any details. thomas farley, a former president of the new york stock exchange, said it would be relatively straightforward for regulators to fact-check some of mr. musk\u2019s statements. mr. farley said regulators could ask to see any legal agreements that tesla has with financial partners or backers on the going-private deal.\u201cif funding is certain, there is documentation to demonstrate that,\u201d mr. farley said. \u201cthis is a very easy one to manage, and they should manage it.\u201dthe probe by the sec adds to a swirl of news around the electric-car

the company private,\u201d the statement from several board members said. the talks included how being a private company could \u201cbetter serve tesla\u2019s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur,\u201d independent directors brad buss, robyn denholm, ira ehrenpreis, antonio gracias, linda johnson rice and james murdoch said in the statement.mr. murdoch, chief executive of 21st century fox, is the son of rupert murdoch, executive chairman of fox and news corp, publisher of the wall street journal. the board has nine members, of which seven are independent. the statement wasn\u2019t signed by mr. musk, his brother kimbal musk or the remaining independent director, steve jurvetson, who is currently on leave.mr. musk and tesla haven\u2019t provided many more details of the potential deal since mr. musk\u2019s tweets tuesday afternoon. the sec generally allows companies to disseminate news using social media as long as they have told shareholders they might use those channels in addition to regulatory filings. tesla told investors in a november 2013 filing to follow mr. musk\u2019s twitter feed for \u201cadditional information\u201d about the company.the company filed its regular quarterly report with the sec monday evening, days after the board discussions had begun, but it said nothing in the report about a potential buyout.tesla wouldn\u2019t be required to tell the public more until something is completed, said jill fisch, a law professor at the university of pennsylvania. if it did, it might say something that later turns out to be incorrect and has to be retracted. still, she said, \u201ci think ensuring a level playing field in the way in which information reaches the investing public is very important.\u201dat the very least, mr. musk\u2019s announcement served tesla\u2019s purposes by boosting its share price. if it remains elevated, that could help the company hold on to much-needed cash, by giving it more flexibility in dealing with convertible bonds coming due soon.tesla has $920 million in convertible bonds that come due in march, with a conversion price of $359.87. if tesla stock is below that level at the time, the company will have to spend cash to redeem the bonds; if the stock price is above that level, the convertible holders will convert them into tesla shares, relieving the company of the need to lay out cash. tesla had $2.2 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of june 30 and free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion in the first half of 2018.tuesday\u2019s spike took tesla stock above the trigger price, and the shares remained above it wednesday, though they slipped 2.4% to close at $370.34. mr. musk has been at war with short sellers\u2014investors who are betting tesla\u2019s stock price will decline\u2014and has used twitter before to joust with them. in an email to employees on tuesday, mr. musk cited short sellers and other pressures public markets put on

producers could face the bigger hit, as saudi arabia accounted for 7% of all grain shipped abroad, said cam dahl, president of cereals canada, an industry association.canadian prime minister justin trudeau on wednesday said canadian officials are in talks with saudi arabia to resolve the row. \u201cwe don\u2019t want to have poor relations with saudi arabia,\u201d mr. trudeau said. \u201cwe have respect for their importance in the world, and recognize it is making great progress on a number of important issues.\u201dstill, the canadian leader reiterated he would continue to champion human rights across the world. \u201ccanadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly, clearly and politely about the need to respect human rights at home and around the world. we will continue to do this.\u201dearlier wednesday, saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir defended the government\u2019s response to canada\u2019s criticism of its human-rights record.\u201cthe crisis with canada was imposed on us because of its interference in our internal affairs,\u201d he told reporters in riyadh. \u201ccanada made a mistake and should correct its wrongdoing towards saudi arabia.\u201dsince may, saudi authorities have arrested some of the country\u2019s most prominent rights activists, many of whom had campaigned for women\u2019s right to drive. at least 14 remain in jail. the saudi government has said those arrested are suspected of having conspired with unspecified foreign entities.mr. jubeir said saudi authorities have been investigating the arrested rights activists as \u201ca matter of national security.\u201dsaudi arabia\u2019s regional allies, including the united arab emirates and egypt, have rallied in support of its hard-line stance on canada. the u.s. has so far declined to take a position. \u201cboth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. we can\u2019t do it for them,\u201d u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said during a press briefing on tuesday.while others have rebuked saudi arabia over the arrest of the activists\u2014including the u.s. and the european union\u2014the kingdom likely chose to target canada because it isn\u2019t a vitally important ally and because of the relatively small amount of business at stake, some analysts say. the broader message saudi arabia is sending to western countries is that it won\u2019t tolerate harsh criticism of its domestic policies.\u201csaudi arabia is saying: our market is opening up, our market provides opportunities, but they can dry up if you are on the wrong side of us politically,\u201d said hani sabra, founder of alef advisory, a u.s.-based political-risk firm.two-way trade between canada and saudi arabia amounted to about $3 billion last year, according to canadian government data. by comparison, u.s.-saudi trade in 2016 stood at more than 10 times that level, based on u.s. data.canada\u2019s plan to sell $11.5 billion in light-armored vehicles to saudi arabia has been met with criticism at home. nongovernmental organizations have pressed that canada open a probe on whether canadian-made vehicles have been used to commit human-rights abuses. it is unclear if the diplomatic spat will affect the deal. officials at the general dynamics land systems, whose canadian unit is building the armored vehicles, declined to comment on the fate of the deal.saudi arabia has used economic pressure tactics toward other countries seen as allies. last year, riyadh and three arab allies abruptly cut relations with qatar and imposed a trade embargo on it, accusing the tiny gulf country of pursuing a disruptive regional policy. at the time, saudi government entities either sold off their qatar holdings or refused to acquire new assets.and in november, saudi officials summoned lebanese prime minister saad hariri to riyadh, where he stepped down from his post, citing the dominant role of hezbollah, an iranian proxy, in lebanese politics. this sparked accusations that saudi arabia, a longtime patron of mr. hariri, was behind the resignation. after germany\u2019s then-foreign minister publicly criticized saudi arabia for pressuring mr. hariri to step down against his will, riyadh recalled its ambassador from berlin and quietly suspended new business deals with its european ally. write to margherita

by a. wilson greene.", "news_date": "2018-08-08 00:00:00", "article": "on may 4, 1864, lt. gen. ulysses s. grant, the union general in chief, crossed the rapidan river with the army of the potomac, commanded by maj. gen. george g. meade. grant hoped to place meade\u2019s army between gen. robert e. lee\u2019s legendary army of northern virginia and the confederate capital of richmond, va., and then defeat lee in open battle. but lee thwarted grant and meade, and for the next five weeks the two armies slugged it out along a front that moved ever closer to richmond. unable to break the confederate line east of richmond, grant made a daring move. unbeknownst to lee, he crossed the james river in mid-june 1864, in an attempt to capture petersburg, va., in one rapid push before lee would be able to rush adequate forces to its defense. a vibrant industrial city of 18,000, petersburg lay just south of the capital. it served as richmond\u2019s logistical center and was the junction of three critical railroad supply lines. the loss of petersburg would render richmond indefensible and, grant hoped, lure lee into a final fight on ground of grant\u2019s choosing.the union maneuver failed, however, and the petersburg campaign continued, stretching from june 1864 to march 1865, making it the longest military operation of the civil war. it is also the least understood. historians have written comparatively little about it, which has reinforced a misconception that the nine-month struggle was a near-static siege, a precursor to the brutal trench warfare on the western front in world war i.by a. wilson greene unc press, 712 pages, $45it is true that the campaign witnessed innovations in siege and trench warfare, but it also consisted of complex maneuvering and numerous battles\u2014several of which, had the union emerged victorious, might have decided the city\u2019s fate early on. as it was, the fighting ground on and on until, in late march 1865, lee failed in a desperate bid to break grant\u2019s lines, eventually compelling the confederates to abandon petersburg and retreat. by then, a final capitulation was only a couple of weeks away, at appomattox.a. wilson greene\u2019s \u201ca campaign of giants: the battle for petersburg\u201d describes the first six weeks of the petersburg campaign, a period that included union assaults on confederate entrenchments (june 15-18); union efforts to secure the three railroads that were the lifelines of petersburg and richmond (june 23-july 1); and the battle of the crater (july 30), one of the most horrific encounters of the war.mr. greene, who has spent a quarter-century living and working on petersburg\u2019s battlefields, first with the national park service and then as head of the pamplin historical park, plans to write three volumes to tell the story of the campaign in its entirety. based on the excellence of this first entry, there is every reason to believe that he will produce a comprehensive and balanced study.such a massive undertaking must pay close attention to the actions of subordinate commanders and units, occasionally down to the regimental level, something that mr. greene does masterfully. he also has a talent for choosing vivid quotations that buttress his conclusions or remind the reader of the horrors of combat. in his account of one doomed union attack, he quotes charles thomas bowen, a sergeant in the 12th u.s. infantry: \u201csometimes a solid shot would knock a file of men ten feet in the air or a charge of canister tear down half a dozen files. . . . arms, legs, headless trunks, & heads without bodies were strewn in every direction.\u201d citing other sources, mr. greene notes that, in the same battle, \u201cmen employed their bayonets and tin cups to create \u2018a miniature breastwork\u2019 behind which they made themselves \u2018as small as possible to avoid confederate fire.\u2019 \u201d such efforts met with only limited success. \u201ca shell decapitated the fifth new york\u2019s color bearer,\u201d mr. greene writes, \u201csplattering his brains over his comrades before that regiment reached cover.\u201dtoo often authors of campaign studies ignore the presence of noncombatants; mr. greene, by contrast, integrates their experiences with those of the soldiers to deliver the fullest possible story. he writes movingly of the suffering that the 18,000 civilians trapped in petersburg endured during the opening weeks of the campaign. among them was a mother who fled her home with three young children under a union artillery barrage that shattered her nerves and left her, as she put it in her recollections of the event, \u201cshaking as if in a chill.\u201dmr. greene is to be commended also for treating the union and confederate high commands in a scrupulously balanced fashion, noting both mistaken calculations and shrewd decisions with straightforward clarity. his analysis of the relationship between grant and meade is nothing short of revelatory. he demonstrates indisputably that meade played a major decision-making role and that his \u201cinfluence over events\u201d equaled or exceeded that of grant.nowhere in the initial battles for petersburg did command miscalculations and criminal negligence factor more significantly than in the battle of the crater, the climactic encounter of \u201ca campaign of giants.\u201d the leader of one union division failed to instruct his men and stayed well behind the lines during the fighting, offering no leadership and drinking heavily. mr. greene treats with grim candor the racial brutality that underscored a battle in which confederate soldiers murdered black union prisoners with heart-sickening fury.mr. greene closes his account by writing that the first six weeks of the petersburg campaign, with so many union efforts thwarted, \u201cbrought little but sadness\u201d to grant. but of course there was much more to come. whether or not one agrees with all of mr. greene\u2019s conclusions, there is no disputing the deep research and profound thought that he has put into his judgments. \u201ca campaign of giants\u201d stands among the most authoritative and engagingly presented civil war studies ever written. mr. cozzens is the author of \u201cthe earth is weeping: the epic story of the indian wars for the american west.\u201d",

national attention, and we didn\u2019t want that. we were trying to keep the national media out of it.\u201dcome again? everyone knows that on saturday president trump sweated through an ohio rally for a state senator whose name probably half the people reading this can\u2019t identify as troy balderson. the national media tsunami that just washed over central ohio depicts mr. balderson as another anonymous foot-soldier in the trump party, formerly known as the gop. it is no doubt true that mr. trump, with his insistently constant public presence, has disrupted the already weak standard model of america\u2019s political parties as arbiters of candidates and ideas. if so, we shouldn\u2019t let mr. trump\u2019s feud with charles and david koch get flushed like so many others. it was a significant event. in an interview, charles koch said trade wars and prosperity were incompatible and that his organization\u2019s financial support wouldn\u2019t depend on party affiliation.this prompted the trump twitter icbm to launch on warning, because naturally mr. trump took mr. koch\u2019s opinion as a personal insult and threat. professional republicans cracked back because the koch network, considered conservative, made clear its support would transcend party affiliation, for example praising north dakota\u2019s democratic sen. heidi heitkamp on financial deregulation. this goes down hard in the trenches. democrats like sen. heitkamp are marginalized outliers in a party wholly at odds with the koch-backed advocacy group americans for prosperity. on the left, nothing like these koch party-crossings is imaginable. that said, the koch feud is a portent of more fractures in the party system. mr. trump tried to dismiss the kochs as \u201ca total joke in real republican circles.\u201d one has to ask: what exactly are \u201creal republican circles\u201d? or for that matter, real democratic circles? the trump camp has taken to insisting that mr. trump personally embodies both the republican party and conservatism. the only people largely forced to opt in to this choice are elected republican politicians. but what about anyone else who self-identifies as a right-of-center voter?there is no cult-of-personality tradition in u.s. politics. it was inevitable that someone as prominent as charles koch would detour off the trump highway. the kochs always made clear that americans for prosperity was primarily about promoting political ideas. their gop affiliation was an assumed freebie. rather than a one-off event or joke, the kochs look more like a phenomenon emerging on the right and left, including moveon, daily kos, breitbart, black lives matter, club for growth and netroots nation. independent and ideological groups are increasingly setting norms for party-affiliated politicians, not the other way round. the parties look more and more like inert vessels or financing institutions. at last weekend\u2019s netroots convention, prospective democratic presidential candidates self-defined in terms of ideology rather than party affiliation. citing the netroots issues of race, sexual orientation and gender, california sen. kamala harris said, \u201cthese are the very things that will define our identity as americans.\u201d asked sunday if the label \u201csocialism\u201d was a liability for democrats, the daily kos\u2019s markos moulitsas said candidates have to either \u201cembrace the label\u201d or be irrelevant. but asked by a reporter wednesday if he would self-identify as a socialist, maryland democratic gubernatorial candidate ben jealous snapped, \u201care you [obscenity] kidding me?\u201dthe traditional parties provided stability and predictability, a comfort level. their competitors\u2014from trumpism to netroots\u2014now offer instability and perhaps a period of chaos. some would call this healthy democratic ferment. others may doubt the health benefits. if it is donald trump\u2019s strategy to suck all the political oxygen out of the room and choke off his competitors, many voters will be driven elsewhere to get air. amid major disruption, anything\u2019s possible. it may be that democrats are drifting left toward alexandria ocasio-cortez, but it\u2019s not beyond imagining that a mike bloomberg could emerge as a liberal opt-out version of charles koch. one encounters conservative and even liberal voters who say they couldn\u2019t get enough of politics in 2016, but now they\u2019ve largely tuned out. they aren\u2019t never trumpers. they\u2019ve become fair weather trumpers who like some of the policy results but can\u2019t stand the daily hailstorms. troy balderson\u2019s near-death experience after his formerly safe ohio house race was \u201cnationalized\u201d suggests that nonvoting fair weather trumpers are a bad omen for the republicans.beyond a likely gop loss of the house, what lies ahead isn\u2019t clear. this is donald trump\u2019s ultimate disruption: an american

the last special congressional election before the midterms. mr. balderson leads by 1,754 votes, though 3,435 provisional and military ballots still need to be counted. the result denied democrats momentum that would have jazzed up their base and helped fill the coffers of dozens of their house candidates.republicans won because mr. balderson was a good candidate and because his rival, democrat danny o\u2019connor, ended up embracing nancy pelosi. but the victory was also a gop team effort. president trump carried the district by 11 points and held a rally there last weekend; trump critic john kasich, who represented the district in congress before becoming governor, endorsed mr. balderson; the paul ryan-associated congressional leadership fund spent $3.3 million; and the republican national committee and the ohio republican party mounted a massive get-out-the-vote effort. while republicans can\u2019t mount this gigantic an effort in every race this fall, neither can democrats, who were left claiming a moral victory for coming very close to taking an open republican seat. but close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. still, it\u2019s not all roses and butterflies for the gop. charles cook\u2019s partisan vote index pegs ohio\u2019s 12th district as an r+7 seat, but republicans carried it this week by less than 1 point.in other words, mr. o\u2019connor ran 6.1 points better than the district\u2019s pvi. in competitive special house elections this year and last, democrats have beat the pvi by an average of 5.1 points.worse yet for republicans, the cook political report says there are 50 at-risk gop house seats that lean republican by as much as or less than the district mr. balderson won by the skin of his teeth. democrats would need to win less than half of those 50 to take the house. mr. cook labels three of these as likely democratic pickups, six as lean democratic, 24 as toss-ups and 17 as lean republican. larry sabato\u2019s \u201ccrystal ball\u201d report has comparable projections.the good news for republicans is that in 36 of these 50 most vulnerable gop districts, republican incumbents are seeking re-election, most with strong district ties and name identification and more cash on hand than their democratic opponents. incumbency doesn\u2019t matter in special elections, but it will loom large in the fall.the bottom line: while republicans will certainly lose house seats in november, they have a fighting chance to keep their majority. they must re-elect almost all of their 36 incumbents whose districts are r+7 or less, put special effort into the eight open seats rated toss-ups or lean republican and whose pvi is even or tilts republican, and go hard after the handful of open democratic seats that lean republican. if they do this they might\u2014just might\u2014hold the house.elsewhere in the midwest there also was some good news for republicans. in five of the six competitive districts in michigan and kansas, gop primary turnout was larger than the democratic total. meanwhile, in washington state\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d\u2014where the two top vote-getters regardless of party compete in november\u2014the results were mixed. a pair of republican incumbents, including house republican conference chairman cathy mcmorris rodgers, failed to break 50%. but in a race for an open gop

has struggled to keep up with evolving sales trends. the supreme court\u2019s ruling in gibbons v. ogden (1824) affirmed the federal government\u2019s power to regulate steamboats crossing state lines. now, the court\u2019s june decision in south dakota v. wayfair has allowed states to tax sales of goods and services delivered to their residents, even when vendors aren\u2019t based there. in wayfair\u2019s wake, courts may soon be forced to rule on the regulation of transactions made via blockchain. if automated delivery vehicles are found to establish \u201cnexus\u201d\u2014or physical presence\u2014for their owners, sellers may be forced to remit taxes in states where they deliver goods. there currently are few limits on the sales rules states can impose, allowing legislatures to lay claim to all kinds of interstate commerce. these new layers of taxes and regulation could raise prices for vendors and consumers.congress must act to simplify the rules of commerce after the wayfair decision. though justice anthony kennedy and chief justice john roberts issued differing opinions on the case, both affirmed the federal government\u2019s power to mandate open commerce. alexander hamilton wrote in federalist no. 11 that unrestrained commerce between the states would \u201cadvance the trade of each.\u201d without a new law to limit state regulation of internet sales, interstate trade will soon be stifled. as a business owner, my main problem isn\u2019t the money my company pays in state taxes. rather, it\u2019s the compliance and paperwork we\u2019re forced to undertake to make sure we don\u2019t violate the law unintentionally. my employees and i must figure out what is taxable and what isn\u2019t in all 50 states and countless localities. is a bolt taxable? in some states that depends on whether the bolt is used to repair office equipment, which is taxable, or to fix manufacturing equipment, which isn\u2019t. taxes on services can be equally challenging. texas taxes different kinds of services at different rates and requires vendors to fill out their own payment permits. for my supply-chain-management company, that means deciding which of three information-technology categories describes our services. to ensure accuracy, my employees and i have to determine whether each customer will use our products for wholesale purposes or whether they are the final user. texas also allows its 254 counties and more than 1,000 municipalities to impose their own sales levies, which must be calculated individually.then come the audits. our company has been audited as many as five times in a year each year. one audit from illinois demanded rental-car and hotel receipts in an attempt to apply the nexus standard to services we delivered to a customer. so each time we do a custom installation or on-site maintenance, we need to check with our accountant to determine if we\u2019re establishing nexus. congress should step in to untangle this convoluted mess of burdensome state rules. in its place, lawmakers should impose clear nationwide standards for interstate vendors. house republicans will have an opportunity to do so in their coming plan for \u201ctax reform 2.0,\u201d announced last month by the ways and means committee. the current outline doesn\u2019t mention state sales taxes. but encouraging economic growth by simplifying taxes is the stated purpose of the reform and was the key to the success of the first iteration. previous attempts to establish fairness in state sales taxes, like rep. bob goodlatte\u2019s 2016 bill, have failed to gain steam. how about reframing sales-tax reform as a way to unleash economic activity and reduce prices for consumers?the council on state taxation, an association of corporate taxpayers, issued a dense report in april that takes 66 pages to summarize the nation\u2019s sales-tax regime. among the best practices identified by the council are exemptions for small businesses, which are critical to boost startup activity, and centralized remittance to one state-revenue authority, which reduces accounting costs.making provisions like these into uniform rules for interstate vendors would help companies like mine expand our operations and reduce excessive record-keeping and pricey meetings with lawyers and accountants. if congress chooses to enact sales-tax reform, interstate commerce will expand and everyone will win. mr. steinmetz is the ceo of baltimore-based barcoding inc.", "summaryGensim": "wayfair has allowed states to tax sales of goods and services

urgent concerns, chicago then experienced its bloodiest weekend of the year, with 74 people hit by gunfire, 12 of whom were killed.six-hundred fifty people were murdered in chicago last year. this exceeds the number in new york (290) and los angeles (282) combined. an estimated 3,000 young men in the windy city are at especially high risk of becoming perpetrators or victims of violence. they are typically high-school dropouts with some sort of prison record who see their future prospects limited to becoming gang members or street corner drug \u201centrepreneurs.\u201d although many city, county and state government agencies, as well as a long list of nonprofits, are working on pieces of the problem, there is no entity tasked with coordinating their efforts. this lack of strategy and leadership reflects a classic management failure.i\u2019ve spent more than six months interviewing a cross-section of those involved in or affected by chicago\u2019s violence epidemic, including drug dealers, gang members, community residents, church leaders, police, nonprofit leaders and officials at the city, county and state levels. these are my key findings.\u2022 the \u201croot causes\u201d are not being effectively addressed. the major problems that give rise to violence are familiar: dysfunctional families, a dearth of successful role models and marginal, union-dominated public schools. most of these high-risk young people have been in and out of the foster-care, juvenile-justice and prison systems\u2014sometimes starting as young as 10. it is easy for young people on chicago\u2019s south and west sides to despair of ever breaking out of their seemingly hopeless situations, especially given the geographic and skills barriers to even entry-level jobs.illinois is a fiscal basket case, so no new resources are forthcoming. but the distribution of existing resources must be reassessed to deal with this crisis. gov. bruce rauner has appointed an executive-branch point person to lead this effort. some possibilities include focusing resources such as mental-health services on individuals in troubled areas, making connections between troubled youth and potential employers, and better data-sharing to identify and help individuals at risk as early and as effectively as possible. but this effort will require cooperation among local and federal agencies that so far hasn\u2019t happened. \u2022 lack of trust in the chicago police department is a major reason for the breakdown in law and order. witnesses often don\u2019t tell the authorities\u2014even 911 dispatchers\u2014what they know, for fear that police will reveal their names to gang leaders. while most chicago police are undoubtedly honest, there are stories from residents of police confiscating drugs and guns and selling them back to gangs.partly as a result of this distrust, the prosecution rate for homicide cases citywide is now an abysmal 17.5%. john maki, executive director of the illinois criminal justice information authority, estimates that in the most violent neighborhoods the rate is in the \u201csingle digits.\u201d imagine: you can murder someone, and there is a 90% chance you won\u2019t be prosecuted. officers hold meetings with local residents with the aim of building trust. this is a good idea but it has been poorly implemented. at the two meetings i attended, the two groups sat across from one another for the required hour but never engaged in meaningful dialogue.\u2022 police morale is poor. officers told me in interviews they are afraid of doing their best in a tough situation and then losing their jobs after lawyers second-guess them based on footage recorded by their new body cameras.the best bet for reinvigorating the city\u2019s law enforcement is to bring in proven police department turnaround experts like william bratton (who headed police forces in new york and los angeles) or ray kelly (who headed the nypd). there is enthusiasm for this idea on chicago mayor rahm emanuel\u2019s staff, but not by the mayor himself, perhaps because he is worried about the political risks.\u2022 as a democratic alderman representing a violent ward said to me: \u201cthe mayor has no real plan.\u201d mr. emanuel is focused narrowly on \u201cshotspotter\u201d\u2014a high-tech gunshot detection system that is helping the police catch shooters in the englewood neighborhood\u2014as a solution to the crisis. but this won\u2019t be enough. mr. emanuel has shown little interest in dealing with root causes of the violence. \u2022 an array of nonprofits are helping, but their efforts are fragmented. former education secretary arne duncan runs a nonprofit called cred, for creating real economic destiny, that is successfully helping at-risk young men train for and obtain jobs. he has determined that $15 an hour is the wage that will get people off the streets and into legal jobs\u2014an assumption supported by my interviews. however, the endless pipeline of troubled youth who need help will outlast groups like cred unless the underlying social problems and police trust issues are more effectively addressed. all of this adds up to a large, complex problem crying out for leadership. young people on the south and west sides of chicago aren\u2019t getting the equal opportunity they deserve as hundreds are killed or maimed. i was born in the south side of chicago, and it is painful to see my city become truly violent once again. without major changes, the killing will continue. mr. macdougal, a former partner of mckinsey & co.,

security.but to the british public, the message has been one of reassurance. the government insists that preparations are well under way to cope with any fallout should the talks fail: brexiters have flooded the airwaves to drive home the message that no deal is no big deal.the government is more honest when talking to foreigners: indeed, the gravity of the situation is a direct result of its failure to be straight with its own citizens. in december\u2019s joint report on the state of the negotiations, the british government accepted an obligation to pay \u20ac40 billion ($46.4 billion) to the eu in settlement of the u.k.\u2019s outstanding financial commitments. yet the government never properly explained this obligation to the british public, instead, sticking to the fiction that it is a down payment on a future trade deal\u2014even though no one believes such a pact can be agreed upon by march 2019, when brexit is set to occur. indeed, dominic raab used his first interview following his appointment as brexit secretary to double down on this fiction, claiming that the u.k. would refuse to pay unless the eu agreed to a trade deal.yet if the u.k. leaves the eu with no agreement and refuses to pay its debts, it will become an international legal pariah, at least in the eu\u2019s eyes. the eu will want to recover what it believes it is rightfully owed and will pursue its claims through international courts. under such circumstances, it is hard to imagine how anything other than the barest minimum of agreements could be struck to avoid chaos on either side of the english channel. the eu will have no incentive to strike deals restoring the hundreds, if not thousands, of legal arrangements needed to underpin commercial and security relationships beyond what is essential to protect its own interests. instead, the eu\u2019s instinct will be to wait until the inevitable chaos brought the u.k. back to the table, as the introduction of capital controls did in greece.british ministers may be right to warn that such a calculation by the eu would be extraordinarily complacent. senior ministers fear that brexiters will rally the u.k. behind a betrayal narrative that will further poison relations with the bloc. the government would almost certainly have to arm itself with emergency powers, allowing it to issue decrees and suspend basic rights as it commandeered resources, creating a warlike political climate inflamed by national defiance.crucially, while the u.k. might be a pariah to the eu, it won\u2019t necessarily be seen as such by other countries. faced with disruption to its european supply lines, the u.k. might find others ready to offer deals that will mitigate the impact of what will inevitably be portrayed as a latter-day continental blockade. the u.s. and china will no doubt be at the front of the line. as a result, the u.k. and eu could find themselves engaged in a protracted bitter stalemate. meanwhile the twin objectives that have informed british foreign policy for most of the past 200 years\u2014the need to avoid uniting europe against the u.k. and to preserve the unity of the west\u2014will have been fatally undermined. no wonder the british government warns of geopolitical disaster.some cling to the hope that rational actors will find a way to avert such a disaster. yet where is the landing zone for which these rational actors should be aiming? the chasm between the eu\u2019s determination to protect its supranational system with the u.k.\u2019s demand for a bespoke intergovernmental arrangement looks increasingly impossible to bridge. the best hope may be that the two sides can ratify a withdrawal agreement that would allow the u.k. to exit in march 2019 in good legal standing, even if little else had been agreed. but thorny questions remain about the irish border and the future u.k.-eu relationship. the vaguer the terms of one, the greater the political demands for clarity on the other.meanwhile, appeals to each other\u2019s sense of geopolitical responsibility look increasingly futile. the europeans think the u.k. underestimates the geopolitical risks of undermining the cohesion of the eu\u2014and in any case aren\u2019t inclined to listen to lectures from a british government that won\u2019t explain the risks to its own citizens. in 1914, a shot was fired in sarajevo that within six weeks sparked world war i. hopefully, nothing so grotesque will unfold this time.nonetheless, a shot was fired in britain two years ago whose consequences are only now

reactions include: \u201care you a trump supporter?\u201d or \u201chow the hell can you be a trump supporter?\u201d or similar queries that are more colorful.the truth is the administration has notable achievements. the recent tax reform improved the structure of corporate taxation. this will contribute to long-term investment and economic growth. it will also increase employment and real wages. tax-rate cuts on the individual side were mostly favorable, enhancing short-term growth prospects in particular. the strong growth of real gross domestic product in the second quarter provides some early evidence of tax reform\u2019s success.regulatory changes have also been pro-growth, particularly concerning energy, the environment and financial markets. and i have to mention the high quality of judicial appointments. remarkably, this strong record of accomplishment has occurred despite nearly monolithic opposition from congressional democrats.unfortunately, these successes may now be more than offset by president trump\u2019s irrational trade war. it\u2019s a fair point that china and some other countries heavily restrict imports, constrain foreign businesses, and steal advanced technologies. countering these actions is a worthy goal. but it won\u2019t work to punish china and others by curtailing the amounts that americans buy from them through imports. the underlying mercantilist view\u2014that there is no downside to cutting off imports because our benefits from international trade arise only from what we sell\u2014is, frankly, ridiculous. living without foreign-produced goods hurts americans more than our trading partners. and the calculations only get worse when one factors in the inevitable retaliation. foreign countries have already begun restricting u.s. exports. they are also entering into free-trade arrangements that exclude the u.s. it is hard to complain about japan expanding trade with other asian countries or the european union, but this expansion comes partly at the expense of u.s. exports.the fundamental benefits of free trade remain, even if they escape the comprehension of the president and some of his advisers. trade allows countries to concentrate their effort and production on goods and services for which they have comparative advantage, either because of underlying endowments or because of scale benefits from products in which they have chosen to specialize. it isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. greater international trade benefits the whole world.at first i thought the president\u2019s rhetoric about trade restrictions wouldn\u2019t be translated into major action. but it is now clear that he, reinforced particularly by commerce secretary wilbur ross, is committed to a trade war. this policy constitutes a serious depression risk, analogous to that from the smoot-hawley tariff of the 1930s. it is possible that actual and threatened tariffs will motivate other countries to join the u.s. in a mutual reduction of trade barriers. mr. trump\u2019s apparently constructive meeting with the president of the european commission is a possible example. but there is extreme downside risk, with the most likely outcome being greater trade restrictions and reduced global commerce. in fact, a danger in the recent pleasantries from the europeans is that they may encourage mr. trump to be even more aggressive in his dealings with china and others.i expected that markets would react sharply to mr. trump\u2019s trade policies and that a sharp decline in stock prices would help limit how far he could go. while the market has fallen with each threat of a trade war, the overall effect has so far been mild. but mr. ross said last month that the administration wouldn\u2019t be deterred even if the stock market keeps falling, writing it off as volatile and uninformative. apparently messrs. ross and trump know better than financial markets and economists about the long-term consequences of trade wars. so far, we have been lucky to avoid a stock-market crash, but we are by no means safe from a future one.to return to my musings about whether i support mr. trump, i recall a long ago assessment i made of president nixon: he didn\u2019t deserve to be impeached for watergate but did deserve to be impeached for price controls. similarly, mr. trump doesn\u2019t deserve to be impeached

november to lose their majority in the house of representatives and a slew of governorships. that\u2019s the clear message from tuesday\u2019s election contests and a growing body of evidence. the president\u2019s persona is trumping positive policy results among voters, and without some intervening news or a change in strategy the result is likely to be a national left turn.republicans appear to have won a narrow victory in the special house election in ohio, with provisional and absentee ballots still to be counted. but a win of less than 1% in a heavily republican district is hardly a show of strength. the democratic share of the two-party vote surged as it has in every special election this year, while gop state senator troy balderson was crushed in franklin county around columbus by 2 to 1.now you can say \u201calexa, play potomac watch\u201d to enjoy our podcast. #askalexathe ominous news for republicans is that they hold about 68 house seats that are less republican than this ohio district. most include stretches of suburbia that have been gop strongholds but where many voters dislike mr. trump\u2019s abrasive style and polarizing governance. democrats need to pick up 23 seats to regain the majority they lost in 2010, and three or four times as many seats could be in play in november.further evidence came tuesday in washington state, where republicans underperformed in two districts they currently hold. cathy mcmorris rodgers, a member of the house leadership, barely led the top democratic vote-getter in a jungle primary in her spokane seat with 47.5%. she remains a modest favorite in the autumn, but the seven-term incumbent will have to spend heavily to win. as for the statehouses, democrats won 137,000 more votes than republicans in the primary for governor. michigan attorney general bill schuette wrapped himself around mr. trump to defeat lt. gov. brian calley for the gop nomination, but mr. trump\u2019s approval rating in the state was 35% in the latest marist poll. democrats nominated career politician gretchen whitmer over a leftist candidate favored by bernie sanders. lansing is now a prime democratic pickup opportunity this fall despite the state\u2019s stellar economic revival under governor rick snyder.the same goes for kansas, of all places, if trump-endorsed kris kobach maintains his 191 vote lead over jeff colyer in the gop governor\u2019s race. mr. colyer became governor when sam brownback resigned to work in the trump administration. mr. kobach will have to persuade republicans in johnson county in the kansas city suburbs that he cares about more than deporting illegal immigrants. tuesday\u2019s results cast doubt on the current white house strategy to make the election a referendum on donald j. trump. the president took credit late tuesday for mr. balderson\u2019s apparent ohio victory, and perhaps his visit to the district saturday evening motivated some gop voters. but his omnipresence also motivates democrats, while it may de-motivate soft republicans and independents who dislike mr. trump.pollster ed goeas of the tarrance group says that his surveys show about 31% to 33% of voters are solidly in mr. trump\u2019s camp. another 11% or so have some doubt about his persona but put a priority on his policies and their success so far. this explains the president\u2019s approval rating of 44% or so. but another 10% of voters like his results but emphasize his persona and thus disapprove of his job performance. this last group are the swing voters gop candidates need in suburban districts to keep the house. they aren\u2019t impressed by mr. trump\u2019s name-calling, his brawls with the media or taunts of lebron james. they don\u2019t like the debacle of family separations driven by immigration-enforcement obsessives inside the white house. trade protectionism also doesn\u2019t help among republicans who work in large companies (and live in those swing districts) and are beginning to see the cost of tariffs. gop policy successes on the economy and taxes are drowned out by the trump cacophony.in this political environment, even the gop\u2019s senate majority isn\u2019t safe. only three or four gop seats are in play, but the party could lose nevada, arizona and tennessee. republicans need to defeat democratic incumbents to hold the senate, which isn\u2019t easy in this kind of year.our sense is that republican voters haven\u2019t recognized how much jeopardy the party is in. many are content to listen only to their safe media spaces that repeat illusions about a \u201cred wave\u201d and invoke 2016 when the media said mr. trump couldn\u2019t win. nearly all of the media does want democrats to win again, and humility was one of the lessons we learned from the surprises of 2016.but that\u2019s not an excuse for ignoring the evidence of gop trouble. mr. trump barely won in 2016 against the weakest democratic candidate since michael dukakis, and hillary isn\u2019t on the ballot this year. mr. calley, who lost his michigan primary for governor, said wednesday by way of explanation that \u201cthis is president trump\u2019s republican party.\u201d the

sea lapping at the coast, and ships crossing the ocean. we think of how naval battles won the dutch their independence from spain in 1648 and subdued their english trading rivals some years later. we think of the daring voyages of the dutch east and west india companies that established the tiny country as a great mercantile sea power. small wonder that 17th-century netherlandish collectors were fond of marine subjects. water, wind, and waves: marine paintings from the dutch golden age national gallery of art through nov. 25 just how fond is demonstrated by \u201cwater, wind, and waves: marine paintings from the dutch golden age,\u201d at the national gallery of art. this delectable show of more than 20 paintings; a large group of drawings, etchings and engravings; and five irresistible very large, obsessively detailed ship models from the period, as elaborately embellished as the richest galleon, celebrates dutch prowess in naval warfare, merchant shipping, fishing and even skating. plus there\u2019s a charming portrait of a richly dressed boy playing with a sumptuous toy ship. there are \u201cportraits\u201d of ships, pastoral waterfront scenes, and reminders of the unpredictability of the ocean. we discover the dangers of seafaring and the pride of a well-armed fleet, the calm of domestic waters and the crowding of boats and ships in dutch river ports, presented against infinite variables of reflective water and all-encompassing skies. i suspect that if any of the works on view were set among dutch golden age genre scenes and portraits, we\u2019d simply acknowledge them without fully registering their special qualities. but in \u201cwater, wind, and waves,\u201d concentrating on a single aspect of 17th-century painting in holland alerts us to nuance and variation so we both discern and appreciate the different ways marine themes were interpreted.for high drama, there are scenes of ships in distress, most impressively the vast \u201cships in a stormy sea\u201d (1671-72) by willem van de velde the younger, about six feet of ominous gray clouds and frothing waves, with the tawny plane of a taut sail, just off center, anchoring the whole composition. a dark tracery of ship\u2019s lines punctuates the smooth sail, emphasizing the picture\u2019s subdued palette and spatial complexity; next stop, cubism. for peace and poetry, there\u2019s abraham de verwer\u2019s \u201cview of hoorn\u201d (c. 1650), all pellucid water and rosy clouds, with the town a narrow band at the horizon and the masts of countless ships stitching sea and sky together. an early 1650s \u201cpen painting\u201d by willem van de velde the elder, a fine black-and-white drawing in oil on panel, presents a crowd of elegant merchant ships and workaday vessels, amid lively dolphins. a series of prints by reinier nooms, called \u201czeeman\u201d\u2014seaman\u2014and made in 1652/54, catalogs the many types of ships to be seen in amsterdam, while a group of works on paper by rembrandt van rijn, including a 1651 etching, \u201cthe bathers,\u201d and a vigorous pen, ink and wash drawing of a view across the amstel river (c. 1646/50). remind us that waterways served for both transportation and recreation. the role of water in its winter state is announced by scenes of skaters and other revelers, including a terrific hendrick avercamp watercolor, \u201cwinter games on the frozen river ijssel\u201d (c. 1626), with well-dressed gentlemen playing kolf, a sort of fusion of golf and ice hockey. marine themes are so entrenched in our conception of dutch golden age art that it\u2019s surprising to learn that such subjects became common only at the beginning of the 17th century. the instigator was the well-traveled hendrick vroom, who used his first-hand knowledge of naval architecture to paint scenes such as the exhibition\u2019s \u201cfleet at sea\u201d (c. 1614) with its warship, fishing boats and cargo vessels tossing on blue-green, translucent waves against a distant harbor. as the exhibition makes clear, later marine painters approached these motifs with more freedom and inventiveness, but usually remained faithful to vroom\u2019s quest for accuracy.almost all the works in \u201cwater, wind, and waves\u201d are from the national gallery\u2019s own collection. only five paintings and those amazing ship models are borrowed. the breadth and depth of the national gallery\u2019s holdings are so impressive that it\u2019s surprising\u2014once again\u2014to discover that until 1985 the museum had only one marine painting, aelbert cuyp\u2019s splendid \u201cthe maas at dordrecht\u201d (c. 1650), with its mass of miscellaneous vessels carrying 30,000 dutch soldiers, assembled to impress the spanish before the adoption of the treaty granting independence to the netherlands. the present wide-ranging collection is a tribute to the initiatives, over his long tenure, of the national gallery\u2019s legendary, recently retired curator of northern baroque painting, arthur k. wheelock jr. caveats? \u201cwater, wind, and waves\u201d lacks a catalog\u2014there\u2019s an informative free brochure\u2014and

challenging a high-profile study that found a popular gene-editing tool could be used to repair a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.two papers published in the journal nature on wednesday raised questions about the experiment, which used the gene-editing tool crispr to fix a potentially fatal heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.concerns stemming from last year\u2019s paper included fears of unintended consequences on embryos and future generations, uncertainty about the emerging science, and whether scientists could prove crispr actually corrected the gene.the qualms have prompted a response from the original research team on their findings in the same journal, a new paper they say bolsters key parts of their earlier work.the flurry of research comes as the complex scientific arguments reflect the ethical dilemmas involved with deciding if gene-editing in embryos could be used in a real-world settingcrispr, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, serves as the immune system of bacteria. scientists adapted crispr and the cas9 enzyme it produces to make cuts at specific points along dna, allowing a repair or insertion of a new sequence in the genetic code, with the aim of curing disease or adding new traits to plants and animals. the possibility of editing embryos, sperm or eggs has sparked controversy in part because any changes would not only alter that individual, but also be passed on to future generations.the original research team, led by shoukhrat mitalipov, director of the center for embryonic cell and gene therapy at ohsu, a public university, in portland, ore., said in the team\u2019s response that additional experiments support the most stunning and controversial finding from the original study: that after crispr cuts the defective gene, which came from one parent, the embryo makes the repair by using a normal copy of the gene from the second parent as a template. this would ensure that the faulty gene won\u2019t be inherited by future offspring.while more research is needed and the technique needs improvement before edited embryos could be implanted in a woman, \u201cwe propose that this type of gene repair can be used for therapeutic purposes,\u201d said dr. mitalipov.the authors of the criticisms said that while the new data advances the oregon team\u2019s claim, doubts remain. the critics argue it is possible, for example, the crispr gene editor cut out far larger swaths of dna than intended, which could explain why the scientists no longer observed the faulty gene.paul q. thomas, a professor at the university of adelaide and senior author of one of the nature criticisms, said his group replicated the experiment using mice embryos. research on human embryos isn\u2019t permitted in australia. dr. thomas said in mice, crispr often cuts out large chunks of dna far from the intended spot, with potentially deleterious consequences.\u201cat the end of the day, the difference between the results in human and mice embryos is still unexplained,\u201d dr. thomas said. \u201cthis is an area where you need to be 100% confident in the results.\u201dthe mitalipov team reported that when they re-examined their samples, they didn\u2019t observe such large deletions.maria jasin of memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york, a co-corresponding author of the other nature critique, said there may be alternative explanations to the mitalipov team\u2019s for how the repair occurred. measuring editing outcomes in human embryos is technically challenging, she said, because \u201cresearch material is so limited.\u201drobin lovell-badge, a stem-cell scientist at the francis crick institute in london who wasn\u2019t involved in the nature papers, said the new data are \u201ccompelling\u201d but questions remain about how and when the repair takes place. he noted there is a time gap between when the scientists inject crispr and when the embryo makes the repair. \u201cno one knows what is happening in the interim, and we need to know,\u201d he said.the debate comes at a time of continuing public interest in ethical issues surrounding editing dna of human embryos, sperm and eggs. the u.k.-based nuffield council on bioethics last month issued a report that said under certain conditions such editing could be \u201cmorally permissible.\u201d a survey of u.s. adults published last month by the pew research center found 65% of americans were uncomfortable with the testing of gene-editing technology on human embryos. write

\u201cscheherazade,\u201d his \u201crussian easter festival overture\u201d and \u201ccapriccio espagnol\u201d are concert standards. the brief \u201cflight of the bumblebee\u201d has been a fixture of pops concerts, especially in virtuoso arrangements for nearly every solo instrument. the so-called \u201csong of india\u201d\u2014recorded during the years before and after world war i by such \u201cgolden age\u201d sopranos as alma gluck and amelita galli-curci\u2014even crossed over from pops classic to pop music, fox-trotted by bandleader paul whiteman in the 1920s and swung by tommy dorsey in the 1930s. in fact, the \u201cbumblebee\u201d and the \u201csong of india\u201d originated in two of rimsky-korsakov\u2019s 15 operas, the former originally an entr\u2019acte in \u201cthe tale of tsar saltan,\u201d the latter a tenor aria, the \u201csong of the indian merchant,\u201d in his opera \u201csadko.\u201d and therein lies the irony: for over a century, rimsky-korsakov\u2019s popularity has essentially ridden on this mere handful of works. but what about the rest?: what of his dazzling c-sharp minor piano concerto, his opulent c-minor piano trio? and what of his splendid operas \u201cthe tsar's bride\u201d and \u201cmozart and salieri\u201d?these are just a few rarities awaiting audiences at this year\u2019s bard music festival, \u201crimsky-korsakov and his world\u201d (aug. 10-12 and aug. 17-19). in fact, one point it will explore is the disconnect between the impressive weight of rimsky-korsakov\u2019s oeuvre and the comparative lack of representation it receives in the west.as a composer, rimsky-korsakov was a primary force in crafting a distinctive russian school of composition. together with composers mily balakirev (1837-1910), alexander borodin (1833-1887), c\u00e9sar cui (1835-1918) and modest mussorgsky (1839-1881), he was a member of the \u201cmighty five,\u201d all essentially self-trained musicians with day jobs in other fields. they saw themselves as architects of a genuinely national musical style with roots in traditional russian folk and church music, independent of the prevailing influence of italian and french opera and german symphony, which they identified with conservatory training. rimsky-korsakov, who had received private piano lessons, was composing pieces by age 10. influenced by his much older brother, a naval officer, he entered the naval college at st. petersburg in 1856, during which time opera attendance fed his growing musical interest. meeting balakirev, cui and mussorgsky around 1861 nourished it further. however, no sooner did balakirev, now rimsky-korsakov\u2019s volunteer music teacher, assign his pupil to learn the rudiments of large-scale composition by writing a symphony than the imperial navy ordered midshipman rimsky-korsakov on a three-year world tour. the symphony was finished and performed after his return home in 1865, but the ocean became a recurring musical theme, in the familiar sinbad and sea episodes of \u201cscheherazade,\u201d and also in his operas \u201csadko\u201d and \u201ctsar saltan.\u201dmeanwhile, rimsky-korsakov, commanded by balakirev to compose intuitively, was increasingly drawn to the academic compositional techniques balakirev despised. this was especially true once rimsky-korsakov joined the faculty of the st. petersburg conservatory (established by anton rubinstein, franz liszt\u2019s russian keyboard rival, a prolific composer and a towering musical figure throughout europe). as a professor there, rimsky-korsakov\u2014for whom the conservatory is now named\u2014essentially taught by keeping one step ahead of his students. assiduously learning on the job, he eventually wrote one of the supreme textbooks on orchestration. he remained a singularly important teacher, most famously of stravinsky and, briefly, prokofiev\u2014but also of the future composer of the \u201cpines of rome,\u201d ottorino respighi, who studied orchestration with him while serving as principal violist of the russian imperial theater.the more rimsky-korsakov learned, the more he revised his own works, many of which exist in multiple versions. he also completed many scores his colleagues left unfinished, among them, borodin\u2019s opera \u201cprince igor,\u201d which rimsky-korsakov and his gifted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 alexander glazunov fashioned from the shambling manuscript that borodin left at his sudden death. more controversial (from the modern viewpoint), rimsky-korsakov made a revised edition of mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cboris godunov\u201d that helped immeasurably to introduce it to western audiences, and which remained the standard version performed outside russia until it was supplanted by mussorgsky\u2019s original later in the 20th century. rimsky-korsakov was perhaps the finest orchestral colorist between berlioz and richard strauss. but while his works are celebrated for their vivid instrumentation, their appeal is also melodic, for, like tchaikovsky and rubinstein, he was a splendid melodist, his outpouring often inspired by folk tunes and orthodox liturgical chant, and frequently imbued with the oriental coloring most familiar in the recurring \u201cscheherazade\u201d violin solo. this scintillating, seductive tonal language became a russian musical hallmark, not just in works by the mighty five, but by a wide swath of composers into the 20th century, including tchaikovsky, glazunov, rachmaninoff and scriabin. their music, together with that of less familiar figures like anton arensky and anatoly lyadov, will also feature on the bard\u2019s stimulating programs, contextualizing rimsky-korsakov\u2019s oeuvre while providing a richly polychrome picture of imperial russia\u2019s extraordinary musical culture.", "summaryGensim": "the symphony was finished and performed after his return home in 1865, but the ocean became a recurring musical theme, in the familiar sinbad and sea

general public. the rally will have fewer attendees than the hundreds who showed up last year in charlottesville, said mr. kessler, a 34-year-old white-nationalist organizer who lives in charlottesville. the national park service approved the application for the rally but declined to discuss security measures, nps spokesman mike litterst said. a gathering by groups opposed to mr.

large counterprotests by a broad coalition of people\u2014from civil-rights groups to militant left-wing groups such as antifa\u2014have overshadowed many planned alt-right demonstrations in the past

stop the removal of a confederate statue from a city park. hundreds of marchers from various white nationalist, anti-federal-government and militia groups from around the nation joined together.the groups and individuals at the rally held a range of extreme political views: some called for a nazi-style nation led by whites, some wanted to re-establish the confederacy, and others called for gun rights and a strict interpretation of the constitution that calls for limited government.one counterprotester was killed and several others were injured when a man drove a car into their group. federal prosecutors charged a far-right sympathizer with a hate-crime act resulting in death and numerous other charges, and the man has pleaded not guilty.an independent review of the violence found the charlottesville police response was \u201cinadequate and disconnected,\u201d and the police chief has since left.individuals on both sides of the violence have been charged with crimes, and many far-right groups face a federal civil suit filed by people who witnessed the mayhem. chris cantwell, a white nationalist and internet radio show host who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault charges

has been \u201ca struggle.\u201dwhite nationalist group identity evropa, whose members attended the charlottesville rally, has had three leaders in the last year. the organization didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but current head patrick casey has said the group would no longer hold public events with other groups.another prominent group in charlottesville, the traditionalist worker party, disbanded. in march, leader matthew heimbach was arrested and charged with battery involving a domestic incident, according to a police report and court records. mr. heimbach, who pleaded not

$420 a share, about 11% higher than the day\u2019s closing stock price. he called the funding \u201csecured\u201d for what would be the biggest-ever corporate buyout, but he hasn\u2019t disclosed details. the board on wednesday said it is still evaluating the plan. tesla\u2019s stock was down 2% to $371.35 in wednesday afternoon trading.taking tesla private would end one of the fiercest debates in recent years between bulls and bears, with mr. musk frequently sparring with detractors and short sellers. it would also shield tesla\u2019s financial health and other competitive information from rivals racing to catch up with their own electric vehicles.in a memo to employees and several twitter messages tuesday, mr. musk said he believes a private capital structure will allow tesla to tap its full potential. \u201cwe are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission,\u201d he wrote in the memo.still, analysts say a key to tesla\u2019s success has been its ability to use the high profile and promotional skills of its ceo and the loyal investor support it engenders to easily raise fresh equity. since it went public in 2010, tesla has raised nearly $4 billion from public stock offerings to help fund operating losses, in addition to more than $13 billion from the debt markets.\u201ctesla has hugely benefited from supportive public markets and from abnormally low cost of capital, which may not be sustained privately,\u201d jefferies analyst philippe houchois wrote in a research note.the billionaire ceo has never fit the mold of public-company ceo. he often has shrugged off badly missed financial forecasts or production targets and has jousted with analysts and short sellers. the pressure mounted in the past year as mr. musk twice missed self-imposed production deadlines, even as he sometimes slept on the factory floor to meet them.leading a private company could allow mr. musk greater latitude to run tesla the way he wants, analysts say, pulling off his unorthodox moves without the penalty of an immediate stock hit. tesla\u2019s shares tanked in 2016 when he merged tesla with solar-panel company solarcity corp., of which mr. musk was the largest shareholder. some investors viewed the deal as a bailout of a firm that had struggled to raise capital.mr. musk said in tuesday\u2019s memo that he has no plans to combine tesla with his other company, rocket maker space exploration technologies corp.\u201che seems to be most excited and operating at his best when he\u2019s afforded the opportunity to simply focus on the company,\u201d jamie albertine, an analyst with consumer edge research, said.for automotive competitors, the move would reduce visibility into a company that has captured the collective attention of a once-skeptical industry.tesla initially was dismissed by auto executives from detroit to germany as a dreamy upstart dabbling in an electric-car market in which consumers had little interest. but tesla soon developed a fervent fan base and drew luxury-car buyers eager to pay $100,000 for tesla\u2019s model s sedan and later the model x sport-utility vehicle.despite persistent losses and production struggles, investors rewarded tesla, which became a bellwether for where wall street was placing its automotive bets. tesla\u2019s market value of about $64 billion is higher than that of general motors co. , and nearly equal to ford and fiat chrysler automobiles nv combined.mr. musk\u2019s go-private plan ultimately could again pressure traditional auto makers, says evercore isi analyst george galliers. he sees a scenario whereby tesla is successful lining up strategic investors to not only take the company private but commit ongoing capital for its international expansion.\u201cthis only increases the need for transition\u201d at traditional car companies, who must manage an overhaul of their product offerings to electric from gasoline-powered \u201cif they choose to compete with a potentially faster and more nimble tesla,\u201d mr. galliers wrote in a note.even as a private company, pressure will remain on tesla to lift production so it can boost free cash flow to pay down its roughly $10 billion in debt and fund planned expansions. mr. musk has repeatedly missed production milestones for the model 3 sedan, the car introduced last year that is intended to transform tesla into a profitable, self-sustaining company.tesla also needs to sell more cars to fund considerable capital expenditures. the company plans to build a factory in china in coming years and has also explored building one in europe. it is also developing a small suv, a booming category.any traditionally-structured buyout deal for the car maker could leave it in a more precarious financial position than it already finds itself. barclays analyst brian johnson estimates tesla would need to pay $2.7 billion annually in potential interest if it were to raise $40 billion in debt to fund a deal. it had just $2.2 billion in the bank at the end of the second quarter, and has $2 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months.going private could also crimp a key recruiting tool: stock options. mr. musk is proposing that tesla create a special-purpose fund for existing shareholders to retain their stakes if they want. they could sell or buy every six months, but shares would be less liquid. write to mike colias at mike.colias@wsj.com and rolfe winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com", "summaryGensim": "since it went

into macro-brew territory with beers as low in alcohol and calories as mass-made lagers\u2014only deceptively, defiantly flavorful. small-scale breweries have, historically, produced big, bold brews. \u201cwe were known for intense, explosive, winelike beers,\u201d dogfish head brewery\u2019s president and founder sam calagione said of his brewery\u2019s early days. \u201cthat\u2019s how we differentiated ourselves.\u201d they won a reputation for some of the wildest beers around. but a strange thing happened in 2007 when they released festina peche, a slightly sour, peach-infused wheat that barely tipped the scales at 4.5% abv and 8 ibus (international bittering units): it sold. \u201cfestina was a runaway hit,\u201d mr. calagione said, and it hasn\u2019t lost steam. while dogfish still sells truckloads of crushers such as 120 minute ipa, the brewery\u2019s seaquench ale, a 4.9% gose released in 2016, has been the fastest-growing beer in the company\u2019s history.what changed? \u201cmillennials,\u201d said lagunitas brewing company brewer jeremy marshall. \u201cthey\u2019re turning 21, they\u2019re more health-conscious, they\u2019re watching gluten and watching calories. but they associate low abvs with the boring beers their parents drank, and they want hops. they want creativity.\u201d lagunitas and other breweries like them are retooling accordingly.yes, lagunitas, makers of boozy bruisers like aptly named maximus (8.1% abv) and hop stoopid (8% abv) is releasing light beer. \u201ci\u2019ve never had a mcultra in my life,\u201d mr. marshall said, referencing the mass-market light beer michelob ultra. \u201cwe\u2019re returning to that macro-lager abv but not the macro-lager taste.\u201d so while lagunitas\u2019s lighter fare weighs in with the featherweights, it packs the punch craft drinkers expect. daytime (4.65% abv), an ipa, is bright and juicy. sumpin\u2019 easy (5.7% abv) is smoothly sweet like a peach-pear creamsicle. lagunitas\u2019s brewers are even working on a sub-100-calorie lager. \u201cour answer to light beer,\u201d said mr. marshall. \u201csuper hoppy, exploding with passion fruit and berries. really exotic. it\u2019s a lawnmower beer for our crowd.\u201dcraft\u2019s new low-abv offerings aren\u2019t always macro-brews done better. some adopt up-and-coming styles. ale industries\u2019 piney uncle jesse (4.8% abv), for instance, is a hazy ipa on a diet. still others go historical. after all, in the centuries before potable water could be counted on across europe, beer was an all-day, every-day drink, and light, refreshing styles abounded. salty-sour gose, bready zwickle and crisp, roasty schwarzbier all tend toward the low-abv end of the scale. wicked weed\u2019s pass the kvassier (2% abv) reinvents a russian rye-based brew as sprightly as kombucha.tuning down their brews shifted dogfish head\u2018s source of inspiration, too, from american hop fields to the european grain belt. \u201cwe wanted something really malt-forward but super refreshing,\u201d mr. calagione said of dogfish head\u2019s latest light beer, grisette about it! (3.5% abv and under 100 calories). the brewers chose grisette, an old-timey french wheat-beer style. to emphasize its grainy character without carb-loading, they used a low-sugar, 17th-century oat variety from columbia, s.c., granary anson mills, along with malted wheat and a little honey. \u201cwe looked at mcultra and bud light as a challenge,\u201d mr. calagione said. \u201chow flavorful and unique can we make a sub-100 calorie beer?\u201dpacking their familiar flavors into svelter abv and calorie counts proved tough, initially, for lagunitas. \u201cwe didn\u2019t use to do 4 and 5% beers,\u201d mr. marshall said. \u201cour equipment wasn\u2019t designed to make them that little.\u201d it was built, instead, around beers like the waldos\u2019 special, an 11.3% triple ipa that uses 19,000 pounds of grain per batch. alcohol comes from sugar, which comes from grain. more grain means more flavor, but also higher abv and more calories. daytime, that light ipa, uses almost 7,000 pounds less grain per batch than waldos\u2019 special. \u201cwe had just bought brand-new brew houses with huge, nine-meter-diameter lauter tuns,\u201d mr. marshall said. (lauter tuns are like giant colanders used to drain sugary proto-beer called wort from water-soaked grains.) \u201cthat\u2019s massive. and so when we started brewing low-abv beers like daytime, we couldn\u2019t fill them with more than, like, a thin cookie of grain.\u201d the colander was draining too fast, so, in the case of daytime, they added oats and rye to thicken the brew, \u201cwhich had the benefit of giving the beer the grainy body it lacked, without the sugar.\u201d they also used an extra dose of hops \u201cfor aroma, plus polyphenols and tannins that add even more body and texture.\u201dthe result is supremely tropical\u2014as well as low in alcohol and calories. but as this and other craft brews prove, the stats are only half the story. these beers are so easy-drinking and so flavorful, you\u2019ll focus instead on everybody\u2019s favorite number: one more. 1. second self havana nights, 4.6% abv with a blooming tartness, this beer seems to ripen as you sip, from early-season berries and green grapes to juicy, deep-pink guava. 2. schlafly summer lager, 4.5% abv the german take on peppy czech pilsners, helles lagers are smoother and slightly creamy. this one has the faint red fruit of strawberry short cake. 3. uinta baba black lager, 4.0% abv looks deceive: a long, cool lager fermentation tempers this schwarzbier\u2019s sharp, black edges into the mellow, slightly acidic zest of cold-brew coffee. 4. lagunitas daytime, 4.65% abv bright and citrusy with a body that balances but doesn\u2019t burden. like lemonade and frosted flakes, white toast and orange jam. 5. dogfish head grisette about it!, 3.5% abv an old french style redone in heirloom malts, wine barrels and warm-fruit hops. like a chewy oatmeal cookie with rum-soaked raisins.",

fight. imports in july were up 27.3% from a year earlier, narrowing china\u2019s monthly trade surplus to $28.1 billion, from $41.6 billion in june. economists polled by the wall street journal had expected a surplus of $39.1 billion.the data came a day after the u.s. said it would start to expand tariffs on additional chinese imports, including electronics and semiconductors, later this month\u2014the latest salvo in the escalating trade battle between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. relations between the two countries have been tense as the trump administration tries to address the u.s.\u2019s $376 billion trade deficit with china, and punish china for alleged pilfering and pressure tactics to acquire u.s. technology.back in june, beijing said it plans to retaliate with tariffs of its own on $16 billion worth of u.s. goods. on wednesday it released an amended list of items that will be affected, which includes various chemicals and medical equipment, as well as certain types of sedans and diesel vehicles.state media, in an editorial published wednesday, said that china will get through this storm, and those placing tariffs on it would end up hurting themselves, without resolving economic imbalances.\u201csome people selfishly swim against the tide and act against morality, wantonly raising the barrier of tariffs and waving the stick of hegemony everywhere,\u201d said the editorial, originally published by the official xinhua news agency.the chinese economy faces strengthening headwinds from weakening consumption to slowed production and investment. the yuan has declined by around 6% against the dollar in the past two months\u2014though that is helping some companies caught in the crosshairs of the trade battle. li jingli, a site leader at an american mechanical equipment manufacturer operating in hebei, said that the falling yuan makes the products it exports to the u.s. cheaper in dollar terms.some items that his company exports to the u.s. are included in an earlier u.s. list of $34 billion in chinese imports subject to tariffs. the company plans to pass onto its customers any added cost not offset by the depreciating yuan, he said.his company is also considering shifting final assembly work outside china, possibly to india or mexico. but that can\u2019t happen fast, as the company needs to get certifications for the types of industrial products it produces. \u201cno one likes the trading war. that makes everyone so busy,\u201d he said.u.s. companies operating in china remain concerned about retaliation beyond tariffs, which could include products getting stuck at chinese ports or delays or increased scrutiny in licensing approvals. beijing\u2019s tariff options are limited because it imports far less from the u.s. than the u.s. imports from china.u.s. chip maker qualcomm inc. is among the most prominent victims of the u.s.-china trade row, having scrapped its $44 billion plan to acquire dutch chip maker nxp semiconductors because chinese regulators didn\u2019t approve the deal before a deadline the two companies had set.state-run tabloid global times, in an opinion piece last week, warned that american brands including apple inc. are positioned to become beijing\u2019s bargaining chips in the trade battle.\u201cthe chinese market is vital for many top u.s. brands, giving beijing more leeway to play hardball in the trade conflict,\u201d it said. \u201cif apple wants to continue raking in enormous profits from the chinese markets amid trade tensions, the company needs to do more to share the economic cake with local chinese people.\u201dapple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.the spat could escalate further. trump administration trade officials have unveiled a list of chinese imports totaling $200 billion that they are considering for 25% tariffs. china followed up last week by unveiling its own retaliatory list of $60 billion in u.s. products, should the $200 billion plan take effect. corrections & amplifications on wednesday china released an amended list of u.s. imports that will be subject to retaliatory tariffs, and said they would take effect aug. 23. an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that there are 114 lines of items on china\u2019s list, and that it hadn\u2019t said when the tariffs will take effect.

cultures in 17th century mexico\u2019s coastal veracruz. today, rising interest in rediscovering traditional culture among mexicans and mexican-americans is helping to fuel a revival.at the forefront of the movement is new york-based singer-songwriter zenen zeferino and the band radio jarocho, who just completed a 20-city summer tour of midsize clubs in the u.s., canada and mexico. other son jarocho bands have in recent years played such high-profile venues as new york\u2019s carnegie hall, joe\u2019s pub, and the brooklyn academy of music.earlier this year, the smithsonian institution\u2019s folkways recordings label released two albums of the folk music. and across the u.s., enthusiasts have used facebook to set up groups that host raucous, communal all-night jam sessions called fandangos\u2014a key part of the son jarocho tradition\u2014from boston to philadelphia to milwaukee.\u201cpeople are rediscovering this music and they are hungry to connect with the tradition on a more personal level,\u201d says eduardo d\u00edaz, head of the latino center at the smithsonian institution. mr. d\u00edaz compared the revival to the interest in cuban folk and jazz music in the late 1990s following the release of the album and documentary film \u201cbuena vista social club.\u201dmore on music\u201cthere is a whole movement of people exploring their mexican roots and heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cthey want to figure out what defines their nationality, their roots.\u201dmr. zeferino, 47, has helped bring the music to a wider audience. he grew up in rural southern veracruz, where son jarocho music originated among communities formed by the descendants of the 200,000 african slaves brought to mexico by spanish colonists to work in the sugar cane plantations and mines.like afro-cuban music, son jarocho\u2014which roughly translates as \u201cthe veracruz sound\u201d\u2014features complex, syncopated rhythms and call-and-response vocal refrains, but european influence brought stringed instruments such as the guitar-like jarana.as a child, mr. zeferino learned how to play and sing at the knees of the old masters. but by the 1980s and \u201990s, only a dwindling pool of enthusiasts remained, as it became \u201cmusic only played by old men alone on their ranches,\u201d he says.in 1991, mr. zeferino joined a group called chuchumb\u00e9, which became legendary in southern veracruz by writing some of the first new, original songs in the son jarocho tradition in over a generation, but never made much of a splash outside of mexico.the group toured extensively and held workshops to teach young players the tradition. at the same time, musicians from veracruz began accepting invitations to travel to california to hold fandango workshops, amid a new wave of interest in roots music among american listeners.but as veracruz has become more wracked by drug violence over the last decade, it got harder for mr. zeferino to earn a living there.\u201clots of the town fiestas and private parties in veracruz take place in places where you have to take back roads to get there, and travel at night. when the narco violence got really bad, starting around six or seven years ago, these are the places that became dangerous,\u201d he said. a command performance for a local drug lord at a seafood restaurant, in which he was ordered to serenade the gangster and his friends for three hours without pay, was the last straw.in 2015, he left for new york, teaching music workshops and playing gigs. he met julia del palacio, a mexico city native and dancer in the percussive son jarocho tradition of zapateado\u2014or footwork\u2014with a ph. d. in mexican history from columbia university, who invited him to join her band,

say which categories, or how many, would be eliminated from the broadcast, but categories such as sound mixing and short films have often been cited by critics as uninteresting to a broad audience.the changes to hollywood\u2019s most coveted award speak to the telecast\u2019s ratings slump and the increasingly marginal cultural influence that the academy has. while hollywood studio returns have focused on megabudget offerings like \u201cavengers: infinity war,\u201d the academy has repeatedly rewarded features whose total gross sometimes equals an \u201cavengers\u201d matinee. at the same

oscars telecast this year, in which \u201cthe shape of water\u201d won best picture, pulled in a record-low 26.5 million viewers. that was a 19% drop from the year prior, the equivalent of losing the state of indiana in viewership.the academy has been trying to fix the problem for years, with many diagnoses centering on the tiny box-office hauls of the movies getting the most awards. in recent years, big winners like \u201cmoonlight\u201d and \u201cspotlight\u201d have collected puny amounts at the box office, especially compared with previous oscar favorites like \u201ctitanic,\u201d \u201cforrest gump\u201d or \u201crain man.\u201d if more viewers were rooting for a popular movie, the thinking goes, they\u2019re more likely to tune in.in 2009, the academy announced it was expanding the best-picture category to up to 10 nominees, a move that was supposed to usher in more popular fare. instead, it mostly added to the mix more independent titles such as \u201cphantom thread\u201d and \u201cnebraska.\u201dthe moves are sure to provoke criticism in certain corners of hollywood, where executives have seen the oscars as a final bastion of honoring quality in the face of endless superhero movies. the academy will face dissent within its ranks, too, from constituents like sound mixers and short-film creators who may see their categories shunted to the commercial

including the obligation to accept migrants from other eu nations. blaenau gwent voters favored brexit by 62% to 38% to leave the eu. it was wales\u2019 highest \u201cleave\u201d vote.\u201cthe money, we got our share, but it\u2019s more important to save wales,\u201d said ken sullivan, a retired coal miner. britain became \u201cso open to foreigners, it was easy to be overrun with different cultures.\u201dthe future of the eu still hangs in the balance, with divisions over refugees in particular driving wedges between its member states. if copious spending during decades of european optimism couldn\u2019t revive fading communities or unite the continent, eu officials worry about what comes next. rising nationalism is pitting smaller, eastern countries against larger, western powers.that is informing debate over the eu\u2019s next seven-year budget, which starts in 2021. cohesion cash, which accounts for over one-third of the eu\u2019s 2014-20 \u20ac1 trillion budget, is under the knife. britain\u2019s payments will start to diminish after its planned exit from the eu next year, which would force the eu to cut spending or demand more cash from europe\u2019s capitals.officials are considering shifting tens of billions of euros in aid from europe\u2019s east to its economically struggling south, including to eu founding-member italy, where a new antiestablishment government is injecting fresh uncertainty into the bloc\u2019s future.\u201cthis is a highly political exercise and not an accounting one,\u201d jean-claude juncker, president of the eu\u2019s executive commission, said during an april eu conference on cohesion policy, in which he opposed deep cuts. \u201cat its essence cohesion policy is about making sure that the life chances in europe are not dictated\u2026by accident of birthplaces.\u201dcohesion funding has transformed recipients, initially along the mediterranean and in ireland, and then in the ex-communist countries that joined in 2004. europe\u2019s fastest-growing economies depend on the cash flow. in 11 of the eu\u2019s 28 states, eu funding accounted for more than 40 cents of every euro governments spent on infrastructure, land and buildings between 2015 and 2017.in some places, such as western europe, the eu sometimes markets its assistance poorly and voters are often unclear about the eu role in a mix of regional, national and european funding.eu funding can carry onerous rules and stipulations involving complex paperwork and restrictions on project types, irking recipients. east european nationalists allege that much of the money flows back to german and french construction companies.donor countries have soured on cohesion funds, too, partly because of alleged corruption among recipients. in hungary, where skepticism of the eu runs thick, the bloc\u2019s antifraud agency says $47.8 million spent upgrading street lamps through eu contracts awarded to a company once owned by prime minister viktor orban\u2019s son-in-law contained \u201cserious irregularities\u201d that may constitute fraud. the son-in-law denies the accusation. mr. orban says hungary no longer needs eu cash.in april, mr. orban won a landslide fourth term, campaigning against the eu, which he said would force refugees on hungary. \u201cstop brussels,\u201d read government-financed pamphlets sent to homes. (the eu is calling his bluff. hungary, poland and the czech republic all face 20% cohesion fund cuts under current plans.)few cohesion-funding recipients are in such direct conflict with donors as poland, which is allotted more than \u20ac60 billion under the current cohesion budget.the ruling law and justice party is purging a 110-seat supreme court on the grounds that about eight of those judges served under communism. the eu says the purge undercuts judicial independence and so triggered a never-used procedure that could fine poland and limit its voting rights in the bloc. a decision is pending. brussels has also sued poland, hungary and the czech republic for refusing to accept refugees as part of the eu-wide relocation plan.donor countries including france and germany want future spending linked more tightly to upholding eu norms. some polish voters and officials call such conditions, which brussels plans to adopt, attacks on their sovereignty by hostile western elites.in lapy, a town of 16,000 surrounded by beet fields, residents had voted 2 to 1 to join the eu in 2003. european assistance, however, struggled to offset the economic upheaval that followed the collapse of communism. in 2008, doors closed at the antiquated, state-owned sugar factory that had converted 370,000 tons of beets into 60,000 tons of sugar annually, leaving 250 people jobless. farmers who had bought specialized beet reapers watched crops rot. locals blamed eu sugar quotas. the next year, a train-repair yard cut most of its 700 workers.foreign supermarkets opened, hurting local merchants. consumers bought imported goods with money wired home by young people who had relocated to thriving polish cities and other countries.religious leaders began to question whether the european community shares the same values as this overwhelmingly catholic country. they have watched closely as ireland, another catholic eu member, voted to allow abortion and same-sex marriage. most poles have indicated they want to stay in the eu. independent polls at home show they also feel wary about giving brussels, the eu\u2019s unofficial capital, more power.the eu \u201cwould prefer that poland not have a say, and instead do everything that they want,\u201c said tadeusz brzosko, a beet farmer outside lapy. \u201cpoles know our own mind and we will do what we see fit.\u201din 2002, at a summit in copenhagen dubbed \u201cone europe,\u201d european leaders charted a rosy vision of what their money would accomplish. the gathering capped three years of debate over whether poland and nine other nations should join as full members and receive economic assistance similar to that which had previously poured into ireland, greece, spain and portugal.development funding would help turn poles into consumers for west european products and services, partly offsetting the cost of assistance, argued advocates such as british prime minister tony blair. poland\u2019s then-prime minister, leszek miller, said the funds would expunge western europe\u2019s failure to save the east from communism. \u201cthis was convincing to them,\u201d mr. miller said in an interview.east european leaders returned home touting the money pledged. some now say this created unrealistic expectations of swift economic change. among eu enthusiasts, the copenhagen summit was seen as a step to eu political union\u2014an idea anathema to easterners who had just shed soviet hegemony.\u201cthis vision was never, never shared in countries like poland or the baltic states,\u201d said g\u00fcnter verheugen, a german politician who oversaw eu enlargement from 1999 to 2004.in rural poland, the proportion of children able to attend preschool has leapt to 84% from 2% in the 1990s, polish officials say. thanks in part to eu funds, poland\u2019s output per capita was forecast to hit 67% of the eu average last year, up from 42% in 1995. the country hasn\u2019t experienced a recession since 1992.pro-eu poles feel the current nationalist government takes credit for an economic turnaround eu money has helped fuel, while blaming the eu for the local businesses that have closed along the way.near lapy\u2019s town square, an eu-funded office complex rents discounted rooms to startups, some given eu grants. radoslaw zaremba received $6,500 to launch a photo studio.when the 30-year-old told his mother about the grant, she told him to be wary because she feared brussels would want the money paid back, mr. zaremba said. for many around lapy, he said, \u201cthe european union is far

sweeping tax overhaul enacted by congress last year created a special 20% deduction for small-business owners\u2014and left many of them waiting to find out exactly who will benefit.on wednesday, the treasury department provided some answers. many high-earning real estate and insurance brokers will get the tax break, but equally-paid doctors, lawyers or financial advisers won\u2019t. owners of closely-held companies should be able to claim the new tax benefit even if a small portion of their income doesn\u2019t qualify for the favorable treatment. but it could be hard for high-earning owners to get around the rules\u2019 limits by splitting up a business\u2014a strategy some tax professionals have dubbed the \u201ccrack and pack.\u201d\u201cthey did try to address some of the efforts to game the law,\u201d said david kamin, a law professor at new york university. the rules also \u201chighlight the arbitrary nature of who benefits and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.as part of its rewrite of u.s. tax rules, congress created a 20% deduction for owners of a variety of pass-through businesses, including limited liability companies, partnerships, so-called s corporations and sole proprietorships. the tax break effectively lowers their top rate to 29.6% from 37%. the deduction can be claimed by business owners whose taxable income is $315,000 or less for joint filers. above that level, the break would be phased out over the next $100,000 of income for service-business owners such as lawyers, doctors and consultants. there are separate restrictions tied to the level of wages paid and capital investment. owners of national football league teams and other sports teams wouldn\u2019t get the break, say howard wagner, a cpa with crowe llp. the new rules \u201cwere tough on the tax-motivated stuff and they were generally quite liberal on making this work for the broad cross-section of taxpayers,\u201d said dana trier, deputy assistant secretary of the treasury during the first part of the trump administration. the restrictions had drawn concerns from businesses owners who receive some of their income from services and worry they might not be able to claim the benefit. under the treasury department\u2019s proposed new rules, business owners with gross receipts of $25 million or less can claim the tax benefit if less than 10% of receipts are from a \u201cspecified service business.\u201d owners with gross receipts of greater than $25 million can claim the benefit if up to 5% of receipts are from such a business.the rules aren\u2019t final, but taxpayers can rely on them for planning purposes, treasury officials said. another restriction would affect high earners in any business or trade where the \u201cprincipal asset\u201d is \u201cthe reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners.\u201d the restriction would apply when a business owner receives \u201cincome for endorsing products or services\u201d or licensing fees, or other income for use of their image, voice or other symbols. it would apply to \u201creality performers\u201d and others who receive \u201cappearance fees or income.\u201d a senior treasury official said the restriction wouldn\u2019t \u201cimpair the ability of most otherwise eligible taxpayers to claim the deduction.\u201dthe treasury department released proposed rules for the 20% deduction available to \u201cpass through\u201d businesses. \u2014laura saunders the rules also include \u201canti-abuse\u201d provisions to address strategies that might allow business owners to circumvent restrictions on who can claim the benefit, a senior treasury official said, such as the crack and pack, where an owner splits a company apart, reclassifying and re-categorizing activities to get as much income as possible taxed at the lower rate.an enterprise at least 50% controlled by a law firm or other specified-service business that provides most of its services back to that firm won\u2019t be able to claim the benefit. \u201cyou couldn\u2019t do the crack and pack,\u201d a senior treasury department official said. but it could claim the benefit if it also sells a product or rents a building to others. a dermatologist could generally claim the tax break for selling skin-care products, provided those sales contribute more than 5% of combined gross receipts, said john rooney, a director at kpmg llp. the proposed rules also include limitations designed to prevent business owners from relabeling certain employees as independent contractors so they can take advantage of the tax benefit.business owners with multiple entities will be able to aggregate those companies for tax purposes provided they have common ownership, the same tax year and meet certain other requirements. that move that will make it easier for some larger companies structured as pass-through businesses to take advantage of the benefit.among the other winners under the new rules are banks set up as s corporations and real-estate brokers, both of whom will be able to claim the new deduction, said dustin stamper, a managing director at grant thornton llp.one of the outstanding questions, mr. stamper added, is whether business owners will be able to claim the deduction on their state income tax returns. \u201cit\u2019s a big question for a lot of taxpayers,\u201d he said. \u201cit will depend on the state.\u201d owners of pass-through businesses filed 35.3 million tax returns in 2015, according to the joint committee on taxation. another 1.6 million returns were filed by c corporations. pass-through companies have become more common since congress lowered individual tax rates in 1986.read the wsj guide to the new tax law. write to ruth simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com and

target of a bidding war involving some of the world\u2019s largest media companies. nbcuniversal inc.\u2019s owner, comcast corp., raised its offer to buy all of sky to \u00a325.9 billion on july 11. the move came just hours after rupert murdoch\u2019s 21st century fox inc., which already owns 39% of sky, increased its original bid to consolidate ownership of the u.k. company. the intensified bidding made the fight for control of sky a central battlefield in the broader clash between comcast and walt disney co. to acquire most of fox\u2019s entertainment assets, until comcast dropped its pursuit of the fox assets. sky is europe\u2019s largest pay-tv operator, with operations in seven countries. it had more than 23 million customers as of june 30, 2018. in the fiscal year to the end of june, sky had revenue of \u00a313.59 billion and a pretax profit of \u00a3864 million.fox is an american tv and entertainment group controlled by the murdoch family trust, which also controls dow jones\u2019s parent, news corp, as well as several u.k. newspapers among other properties. on june 20, fox agreed to sell most of its assets to disney--including the sky interest. a previous deal reached in december, was challenged by comcast, which dropped its pursuit of the assets on july 19. comcast is an american cable juggernaut that owns nbcuniversal as well as the xfinity cable and telecommunications service. it attempted to buy fox\u2019s entertainment assets, making an unsolicited bid for them on june 13, but walked away weeks later. it continues to seek the acquisition of sky. walt disney is the american media conglomerate that houses the namesake disney brand, star wars franchise owner lucasfilm, u.s. sports channel espn and marvel in its portfolio. disney said on june 20 that it would assume full-ownership of sky if fox buys the stake it doesn\u2019t own prior to completion of the deal between the two american companies.with a market value of \u00a326.06 billion as of july 30, sky has a more modest scale than its american suitors. but it is in many ways a smaller version of what american media companies are trying to become: an integrated distribution platform that produces its own content. comcast has lifted its offer price for sky to \u00a314.75 a share, valuing the company at $34 billion. that represents a 5% premium to fox\u2019s latest offer and an 18% increase to comcast\u2019s previous \u00a312.50-a-share bid. comcast said its latest offer was recommended by sky\u2019s independent directors, who withdrew their earlier support of the fox bid. fox had raised its original bid by 30% to \u00a314.00 a share for the 61% of sky it doesn\u2019t already own. fox launched its bid to consolidate ownership of the u.k. satellite-tv company in december 2016. however, the deal came under the scrutiny of british regulators, who after a lengthy review formally cleared it on july 12. fox agreed to sell sky\u2019s news operations to disney with a promise to fund the news service with at least \u00a3100 million a year for 15 years, to ease government\u2019s concerns that a sky takeover would give the murdoch family too much influence over u.k. media.fox said on aug. 7 that the deal is dependent on approval from shareholders representing 75% of sky shares that it doesn\u2019t currently hold. however, fox said it reserves the right to reduce the acceptance condition to a level not less than a simple majority of all sky shares. fox launched its bid to consolidate ownership of sky in december 2016, but the deal was held up by british regulators. in december 2017, fox agreed to sell most of its assets--including its current 39% stake in sky--to disney. from then on, the fate of the sky takeover was linked to that of the much larger fight for the fox assets.comcast, which had tried to strike a deal with fox for its entertainment assets, emerged as a suitor for sky in february, confirming a takeover proposal in april. in june, comcast made a separate, unsolicited offer for the fox assets as a whole. the comcast move triggered a higher offer from disney for those assets, which was accepted by fox. disney said then that it would take full ownership of sky upon completion of the fox deal, if fox ended up buying the 61% of the u.k. company it doesn\u2019t own. fox, backed by disney, increased its offer on july 11, but comcast quickly responded with a higher offer, which received the support of the sky independent directors. days later, comcast dropped its pursuit of the fox assets and said it would focus on buying the british pay-tv group. shareholders of disney and fox approved the $71 billion deal between the two companies on july 27.mr. murdoch\u2019s first attempt to take over sky at the beginning of the decade failed amid a public and political backlash over his now-defunct u.k. tabloid newspaper news of the world\u2019s phone-hacking scandal. comcast has extended the period for sky shareholders to accept its offer until 1200 gmt on sept. 12 after receiving acceptances for just 0.21% of sky shares by the first deadline of aug. 22.fox published its own offer documents on aug. 7, triggering a 46-day deadline to revise its bid. under u.k. takeover rules, fox will now have until sept. 22 to raise its proposal and try to outbid comcast. the first closing date for sky shareholders to accept fox\u2019 offer is sept. 17.separately, the u.k. takeover panel has ruled that disney would be required to offer \u00a314.00 a share for 61% of sky if it succeeds in acquiring fox\u2019s entertainment assets, setting a new floor price in the bidding war for the british media group. the regulatory body confirmed its decision on aug. 3 after a hearing requested by various interested parties, but on aug. 8 the panel said it would consider appeals lodged by several interested parties against the ruling. it has scheduled a hearing to consider the appeals for aug. 15analysts have speculated that disney could reach an agreement with comcast and cede the european business to the cable company. however, disney chief executive robert iger indicated on aug. 7 that he wanted to win sky, citing it

drain, resulting in catastrophic buildups of sludge in sewer systems.when poured down the drain, the fat coats the sides of the water line, gradually building up and narrowing pipes. grease that doesn\u2019t stick to residential pipes eventually makes its way to the city sewer system, where it can accumulate to form massive blockages. clogs have gotten so big that workers have to use shovels to get the fat out.london officials had to excavate a 130-ton \u201cfatberg\u201d from the whitechapel sewer last year. the monstrous glob was the size of 11 double-decker buses and consisted mostly of grease runoff and trash.in baltimore, officials last year had to scrape out a 24-inch pipe in midtown where grease had congealed, clogging 85% of the pipe.after noticing that there had been some overflows around the city center, the public-works department sent a camera down and discovered a 20-foot long buildup of fat, according to jeffrey raymond, chief of communications at the baltimore department of public works. \u201cit was really pretty shocking,\u201d he said.baltimore resident sarah ross, 27, said she hadn\u2019t realized the consequences of pouring fat down the drain, which she does regularly, until she learned of the city\u2019s sewer problem.\u201ci\u2019m not going to defend making a fat clog, i\u2019m not supporting making any fatbergs. that\u2019s deplorable,

argentina. the turkish lira has fallen almost 30% against the dollar this year and yields on its bonds have risen fast, but investors question whether president recep tayyip erdogan would ever agree to the sort of stringent demands that the imf asks for in exchange for loans. the imf said wednesday that turkey hasn\u2019t asked for its help. it may never do so. but the idea that the imf is there can act as a backstop for the currency and bonds of troubled countries. many investors currently don\u2019t see that safety net easily coming together for turkey, adding to the pressure on one of the world\u2019s largest emerging markets.\u201ci think it\u2019s hard to believe that the imf could help turkey or for turkey to ask for the imf to help in a balance of payments crisis,\u201d said luca sibani, senior portfolio manager at epsilon sgr. \u201cthis is a further element of vulnerability\u201d for turkey, he said.emerging markets have come under intense pressure amid a strengthening dollar, higher u.s. interest rates and an escalating trade conflict. that heaped extra strain on argentine bonds and the peso earlier this year, but its june imf\u2019s deal stabilized the country\u2019s markets.for turkey, investors worry about president erdogan\u2019s influence over monetary and economic policy after he granted himself the right to appoint the central bank\u2019s governors and named his son-in-law as finance minister. investors fear the growing sway of mr. erdogan, who has expressed a preference for lower rates, will discourage the central bank from taming inflation that hit an annual rate of 15.85% in july.turkey is especially vulnerable to falling currency, given the nation\u2019s large pile of foreign-currency debt. its external debt stood at 53% of gross domestic product at the end of 2017, according to the imf, one of the highest levels among emerging economies. as the lira slides, that debt becomes more expensive to pay off. what\u2019s more, over a third of that debt comes due within a year, while 40% is in floating rate debt, making it more expensive to repay as interest rates rise.the imf is likely to see turkey very differently to argentina, analysts say. argentina\u2019s president mauricio macri secured a rapid and large bailout in part because he was perceived as trying to return discipline to the country\u2019s economy.mr. macri had already instituted programs to cut spending and bring argentina\u2019s fiscal and current account deficits back under control\u2014the sort of steps the imf requires with its rescue programs.when mr. erdogan took office in 2003, turkey was two years into an imf bailout plan under which it was receiving billions of dollars\u2019 worth of loans in exchange for implementing the fund\u2019s recipe of fiscal and budget rigor.although the bailout plan was widely regarded as thrusting turkey\u2019s economy on a steady growth track, mr. erdogan has consistently minimized the fund\u2019s role, instead crediting his own stewardship for the recovery. having won re-election in late june on the pledge to build a turkey unbeholden to outside powers, mr. erdogan will be loath to call the imf to the rescue, analysts say.\u201cthere is no such thing as the imf on turkey\u2019s agenda,\u201d a turkish government official said wednesday.mr. erdogan\u2019s combative record with other nations could also work against turkey. a bailout needs the support of the imf executive board which comprises representatives from the member countries, of which the u.s. has by far the largest voting share.last week, washington imposed sanctions on two turkish government ministers in response to turkey\u2019s detention of an american pastor on terrorism charges that the u.s. say are politically motivated.by contrast, president trump and argentina\u2019s macri have a good relationship; mr. trump offered early support for mr. macri\u2019s government after currency woes struck.still, if turkey\u2019s situation deteriorates it could face few other options than coming to the imf.\u201cno economy can survive 5% plus currency drops a day on a sustained basis,\u201d said viktor szabo, senior investment manager at aberdeen standard life.\u201cat the end of the day, the imf might indeed be the only solution, but i still think it will be a huge (political) uphill

capital, the home later was occupied by a woman who fought the nazis and then by a top actress. it is now listed for about $2.2 million.", "news_date": "2018-08-08 00:00:00", "article": "in the spring of 1881, a fledgling norwegian artist got a crucial bit of encouragement when his cousins hired him to paint an interior scene of their home\u2014a cozy, two-story clapboard house outside the center of what is now oslo. that artist was edvard munch, painter and printmaker of iconic works such as \u201cthe scream.\u201dhis first commission, \u201cthe living-room of the misses munch in pilestredet 61,\u201d is in the permanent collection of oslo\u2019s munch museum, and the 2,500-square-foot house, set back from a street in the buzzing inner oslo neighborhood of bislett, is now on the market for 18 million norwegian kroner, or about $2.2 million.the five-bedroom, three-bathroom house, which dates to at least the early 19th century, sits on a one-eighth acre lot, presided over by an old pear tree. in munch\u2019s time, it was the home of his father\u2019s cousins, sisters caroline and henriette munch, who lived there until 1911. later, it was split into two apartments. two notable norwegian women resided in the house over the following decades. in the mid-1970s, the ground floor apartment was used by a world war ii heroine, oslo lawyer asvor ottesen, who, under the code name \u201clilly jensen, \u201d worked with a group of norwegian saboteurs fighting the country\u2019s nazi occupation. in april 1986, norwegian actress rut tellefsen, a grande dame of the oslo stage, bought the same apartment, which came with a basement studio. at the time, she was acting in george bernard shaw\u2019s \u201cpygmalion\u201d at oslo\u2019s national theater. a cast member told her his mother was selling the flat. \u201ci biked down and saw two fruit trees\u2014the pear and the apple\u2014and i made up my mind to live here,\u201d she recalls. only after buying did she learn of the munch connection. the apple tree was damaged in a storm, but the pear tree still sets the tone in the garden.she paid about $107,000 for the flat, and later made the basement studio into a guest apartment. in 2016, she bought the upstairs apartment for about $774,000. she hosted many parties in her bucolic backyard. one frequent visitor was her friend the norwegian actress and director liv ullmann. ms. tellefsen, 87, and her 62-year-old daughter, pia, have decided to sell, following a recent operation of the mother and her decision to move into a west oslo apartment.the sitting room made famous by munch now holds mementos from the actress\u2019s long career. a painting of her in character hangs where the munch sisters\u2014whom the young artist referred to affectionately as his aunts\u2014hung what apparently were a few family portraits.munch, 17 years old when he painted the living room, was largely self-taught at the time, says jon-ove steihaug, director of exhibitions and collections at the munch museum. it was just in the previous year, says mr. steihaug, that munch resolved to be a painter. he gave up engineering studies, buying his first set of paints and brushes just months before the sisters hired him. munch was traumatized by the deaths of his mother and favorite sister. he rendered the grief and alienation in his art, with an expressive fervor that influenced generations. but his account of painting his cousins\u2019 living room is marked by graciousness\u2014even joviality.\u201cyesterday i completed the painting for the munch aunts,\u201d he wrote in his diary on may 5, 1881. \u201cto mark the occasion, they served me a large cup of chocolate, and then gave me quite a beautiful sketchbook as a remembrance.\u201dasvor ottesen used a small bedroom during her years in the house, says pia tellefsen. at the time, her wartime activities were largely unsung, says oslo historian lars borgersrud.ms. ottesen (1911-2003) was associated with the osvald group, part of the norwegian resistance, says mr. borgersrud. she planted a bomb in a german officers\u2019 recreational facility, he says, and helped plan what he calls one of the most important acts of sabotage in the war. in august 1942, the group attacked the oslo headquarters of the statspolitiet, a police force made up of norwegian collaborators. the successful attack \u201cshowed the norwegian resistance what was possible,\u201d he says.ms. ottesen was \u201cincredibly brave,\u201d says the historian, who interviewed her in 1990.today, rut tellefsen\u2019s house is a pre-modern outpost in norway\u2019s capital, which is one of europe\u2019s fastest-growing cities. the bislett neighborhood may not have changed much between 1911, when the house passed out of the munch family, and the 1980s, when the tellefsen clan arrived, but it has undergone a sea change in the past decade, says pia tellefsen, as shops and restaurants give the area a new liveliness.the house remains quaint, she adds, noting that it has protected status, meaning it can\u2019t be torn down. knut rickoff christensen of eie eiendom is handling the sale. want more real estate? get a

followed a report that a saudi investment fund had taken a nearly 5% stake in tesla.the notion of a buyout, which would value tesla above $70 billion, is itself extraordinary, as it would be far larger than any previous take-private deal. it immediately set off a guessing game of where mr. musk would get the funds.the way mr. musk broke the news added to the drama, disclosing in a casually worded tweet the prospect of a buyout that would be an enormously complicated transaction for a company struggling to generate cash. it was a shocker even for investors who are often whipsawed by mr. musk\u2019s erratic comments on twitter\u2014he joked earlier this year about tesla going bankrupt\u2014and it intensified a battle between his supporters and a legion of bearish investors who have made tesla the most heavily shorted stock.while mr. musk continued tweeting about the possibility over the next few hours on tuesday, tesla\u2019s public-relations team and main twitter account remained silent, adding to the intrigue. an hour before the market closed, while tesla\u2019s stock was halted on nasdaq, tesla on its corporate site published a memo it said mr. musk sent to employees that confirmed his thinking.the shares jumped when they resumed trading late in the day, gaining 11% to $379.57, or about 10.7% off the $420 threshold.in the memo, mr. musk wrote that no final decision on a buyout has been made. he wrote that taking the company private would avoid the \u201cwild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at tesla\u201d and take away from short sellers \u201cthe incentive to attack\u201d the company.tesla would create a special-purpose fund that would let existing investors keep their shares, mr. musk wrote. the unusual maneuver would let shareholders buy or sell shares every six months, he wrote, but it wasn\u2019t clear how such a fund would work or what the tax implications would be. companies usually spell out the details of such proposed complex transactions in comprehensive, lawyered documents.mr. musk owns about 20% of tesla, with insiders owning another roughly 5% and individual investors holding about 12%. the remaining 62.2% is held by institutions.\u201cbasically, i\u2019m trying to accomplish an outcome where tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees,\u201d mr. musk wrote.the memo and mr. musk\u2019s tweets left many questions unanswered. most prominently, mr. musk didn\u2019t say who would pay for the buyout, leaving many observers skeptical he could pull off such a transaction.saudi arabia\u2019s public investment fund recently completed the purchase of a nearly 5% stake in tesla, a senior saudi adviser familiar with the matter said on tuesday. he said he wasn\u2019t aware of any plan by the saudi investment fund to increase its holding in tesla. the financial times earlier reported news of the fund\u2019s stake.tesla lacks many of the characteristics of a typical leveraged buyout candidate, including a large, predictable stream of cash flow. even though its sales are rising, tesla still has been losing money and burning copious amounts of cash. the car maker also has regularly missed financial and production targets.in a typical lbo, the buyer contributes a relatively small amount of equity and uses debt to fund the remainder of the transaction. even accounting for mr. musk\u2019s ownership stake, and any additional equity he could raise, such a deal would require tens of billions of dollars in bank borrowing, and it isn\u2019t clear who would provide it.tesla\u2019s market capitalization is about $60 billion. at $420, a buyout would cost about $72 billion\u2014by far the largest lbo ever, according to dealogic. it would eclipse the current record holder, energy future holdings corp., formerly txu corp., which was bought in 2007 for $32 billion. the texas utility filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.the surprise tweets on tuesday came as mr. musk\u2019s long-combative stance against tesla\u2019s short sellers has grown testier in recent months. he has repeatedly used twitter to chide investors who are betting against his company, sometimes offering vague positive outlooks for the company that seemed to boost the stock, hurting short sellers\u2019 positions. mr. musk has been embattled for several months amid investor concern over whether the company\u2019s fremont, calif., factory can ramp up production of the model 3 sedan. he told analysts last week that the pace of 5,000 sedans a week\u2014a milestone tesla reached toward the end of june\u2014can be sustained, despite skepticism from some analysts.mr. musk has insisted that the increased pace of model 3 output will allow the company to avoid the need to raise more capital. but many equity analysts aren\u2019t convinced. in a research note tuesday, morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said he expects tesla to raise equity of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, despite hiking his model 3 production forecast by 50%, to about 50,000 cars in the third quarter.mr. musk has promised investors that tesla, which went public in 2010, would start making a profit as of the third quarter. the company finished the second quarter with $2.2 billion of cash, and has said it needs a minimum cash balance of $1 billion.morningstar analyst david whiston said the recent progress on model 3 production \u201cgives more credibility to the company\u201d if mr. musk\u2019s plan is to secure funding for taking tesla private.taking it private would allow the billionaire \u201cto not constantly worry about going to the public markets for more money,\u201d mr. whiston said. \u201che can do what he needs to do behind closed doors and keep growing the company without all that extra scrutiny.\u201dmr. musk has informally floated the idea of a private tesla before. in an interview with rolling stone published in november 2017, he said having to answer to public shareholders \u201cmakes us less efficient,\u201d and said \u201ci wish we could be private with tesla.\u201dhe has also toyed with taking his other company, space exploration technologies corp., public. the rocket maker, where mr. musk is ceo, was last valued privately by investors at $21 billion. but mr. musk has nixed that idea more recently, people close to him have said, because the entrepreneur in him just couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of being held publicly accountable to shareholders. write to mike colias at mike.colias@wsj.com and miriam gottfried at

adapted from his 1986 feature film. he spoke with the journal about race, politics, activism and his new film. here are edited excerpts:more on film race has been an important topic for you throughout your career. how has your concept of it changed since you first began? i just feel that we\u2019re never, ever going to get anywhere on race in this country until we have very, very honest, painful conversations about the origin of this country. people try to change the narrative, but the foundation of the united states of america is based on the genocide of native people and slavery. that has to be the starting point. if you don\u2019t start from there, then it\u2019s a lie. it cannot be avoided, it cannot be skipped, it cannot be written out. that\u2019s the alpha, that\u2019s the beginning.if we don\u2019t do that, then we\u2019re still gonna be talking about this 20 years from now, the same shit. one question comes up repeatedly throughout the film: \u201care you down for the liberation of black people?\u201d what does that mean for audiences in 2018? black people, the gay population, people of color, in many cases are still treated as second-class citizens in the united states of america. even though the film takes place in the early \u201970s, i think that question still exists. even though the character patrice is asking that question of ron stallworth, she in a way could be asking that question to the audience: are you down for the liberation of black people, of immigrants, of the gay population, for women\u2019s rights?that\u2019s a big question, because for me, i don\u2019t know how you could be down for the liberation, the rights of gay people but not down for black people, or vice versa. it\u2019s all the same. what was it like working on a period piece that contained themes relevant to society today? my man, that was by design. that was not a mistake. that was planned, that was strategized. even though this is a period piece, we still wanted to make it look, feel contemporary with what\u2019s happening in the world we live in today. that\u2019s the reason i took the job when it was offered to me by jordan peele, because i knew that with this period piece, we could speak the truth to what\u2019s happening here today. truth to power. code-switching (changing how you speak based on the audience or setting) plays a big role in this movie. how is that relevant to audiences today? \u2018cause a lot of people do it! whether you\u2019re black, you\u2019re gay, or this or that, you\u2019re faking the funk, because society has put up there that it might be horrible for you if you be who you truly are. they don\u2019t code-switch because they want to. they do that stuff because it\u2019s advantageous. toward the end of the film, we see the return of the double-dolly shot, where the camera and actors are all on dollies so that they appear to be floating as they walk. why is that such a staple for you? it\u2019s not a return!

efforts to corral the menagerie of animals in airplane cabins have fizzled this summer.delta, american, united and other carriers tightened requirements on emotional-support animals, trying to curb the dramatic increase in dogs, cats and other creatures flying uncaged with airline passengers. in some cases, 50-pound dogs share space in cramped coach seats with their owners and neighboring passengers.delta says it has had six biting incidents in the past 60 days. the airline now carries about 700 emotional-support animals and service dogs on flights each day, up from 450 a day in 2016. the total number of animal incidents on airplanes\u2014from urination to barking to biting\u2014has increased 84% since 2016, says gil west, delta\u2019s chief operating officer. in june, a delta flight attendant was badly scratched by a pit bull and delta banned that breed from riding in its cabin. \u201ci think we\u2019ve hit a tipping point,\u201d mr. west says. \u201cwe\u2019re very concerned about the safety of our customers and our crew.\u201dlast year, the number of pets carried by u.s. airlines (usually for a fee in the cabin or cargo hold) increased 11% to 784,000, according to airlines for america, the industry\u2019s lobbying organization. the number of service animals increased 24% to 281,000, according to a4a. and the number of emotional-support animals leapt 56% in that one-year period, to 751,000.in general, service dogs undergo lengthy training to aid an owner with a disability, including sight-limited or physically limited people and people with diagnosed emotional issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. emotional-support animals can be untrained and provide benefit simply from companionship. they aren\u2019t considered service animals under the americans with disabilities act.delta and united implemented new rules in march, alaska in may and american in july. the airlines now require documentation from veterinarians that emotional-support animals are healthy and trained to behave properly in public. passengers must turn in documents 48 hours before departure. some airlines require a letter from a mental-health professional certifying the passenger\u2019s need for an esa or psychiatric service animal.airlines say these changes are as far as they can go under current federal rules. and the changes have had minimal effect so far, they say.united says the number of in-cabin pets it carried dipped in february, compared with the same month in 2017, after the airline announced tighter rules, and was down in march when the requirements went into effect.but then the volume increased again in april, went higher in may and stayed up all summer at comparable levels to last year. united has seen a 75% increase in onboard incidents in the past year.\u201cthis has gone too far,\u201d spokesman charles hobart says. \u201cthe march 1 rule changes represent our best approach to insuring onboard safety and reducing fraud under the dot\u2019s existing rules.\u201ddelta says numbers have bounced up and down, and it\u2019s too early to tell the full impact, since some changes didn\u2019t kick in until july 10.in may the transportation department asked for public input on possible rule changes. now the agency says it is reviewing the 4,467 comments it received. the dot tried once before to issue new rules, but an advisory board it established couldn\u2019t agree on limits and definitions. it\u2019s possible this effort could run into the trump administration\u2019s opposition to new regulation. but in this case, airlines are begging for new regulations rather than opposing them.in a statement, the dot says it\u2019s not against all new regulation. \u201cthere should be no more regulation than necessary, and those regulations should be straightforward, clear and designed to minimize burdens consistent with safety, consumer protection and access to air travel,\u201d a dot official said. airlines are urging the dot to make guidelines in the air carrier access act similar to the americans with disabilities act. the acaa is far broader. some travelers like being able to take their pets with them when flying. many insist the animals do provide necessary emotional support amid the rigors and stresses of air travel today. many travelers don\u2019t want their pets to travel as cargo in the belly of planes.but people who rely on highly trained service animals for daily needs say their service dogs can be provoked by aggressive dogs unfamiliar with airports and airplanes. if a service animal acts out, it may have to be retired. people with animal allergies say flights with multiple pets have grown more common, exposing them to more allergens.and travelers say they are running into more animal incidents. rani khetarpal, a marketing executive from california who has elite status on several airlines, says flight attendants on an american flight she was on july 12 refused to work the trip because of a large pit bull on board. they feared a confrontation with the dog in the aisle.the captain intervened and convinced the dog owner to switch seats with someone in a window seat, so the flight attendants could work in the aisle without mingling with the dog. the flight departed only slightly late.\u201ci just think there should be stricter parameters put around it,\u201d ms. khetarpal says. \u201ci don\u2019t know what that looks like. there is a need, but people are taking advantage of the esa policy, and it\u2019s not right.\u201dwhen airlines first imposed fees of up to $125 each way on traveling with pets, people started sniffing around for loopholes. declaring a pet an emotional-support animal evades fees and rules limiting the size of pets allowed on board. certificates and doctors\u2019 letters that many airlines require are readily available online.but airlines say fee avoidance is far from the whole story. the number of passengers paying pet fees continues to go up. there\u2019s also a cultural change happening. pets are family, welcomed at hotels and restaurants. once air travel with pets became easier, the barn door opened. j.d. floyd, a traveler who logs more than 100,000 air miles a year as a financial consultant, has seen countless dogs and one ferret fly as emotional-support animals. they cause fewer problems than rambunctious children, he says. to him, emotional-support animals have just become the latest way to game the system and thumb a nose at harsh airline rules.mr. floyd points to passengers who haul oversize bags to gates and then line up quickly when agents ask for volunteers to check bags, thus avoiding baggage fees.\u201cit\u2019s not just emotional-support animals when it comes to travel gaming,\u201d he

severe restrictions on movement.maungdaw, home to nga khu ya, was the center of last year\u2019s bloodshed. a rohingya militant group launched attacks on aug. 25 on police posts in the district, and

helped fuel the national black lives matter movement.many onlookers saw the election as a referendum on what happened in ferguson. it marked the first time mr. mcculloch had been challenged since mr. brown\u2019s death.mr. brown, a black and unarmed 18-year-old, died on aug. 9, 2014, in a street confrontation with white officer darren wilson. some witnesses said mr. brown had his hands up in surrender. mr. wilson said mr. brown was moving aggressively toward him and he fired the fatal shots in self-defense.a st. louis county grand jury declined to indict mr. wilson, who later resigned. critics accused mr. mcculloch, who is white, of skewing the investigation in favor of the officer.the u.s. department of justice launched its own investigation. while the justice department found no grounds to indict mr. wilson, a scathing report found racial bias in the way ferguson police and courts treated black people. a consent agreement requires the city to take several steps to remove that bias, including hiring more minority police officers, court reforms, and other measures.mr. bell campaigned on a platform to \u201cfundamentally change the culture\u201d of the prosecutor\u2019s office, partially by assigning special prosecutors to review allegations of police misconduct. black residents make up about 23% of st. louis county\u2019s population.mr. bell and mr. mcculloch are both sons of police officers. but mr. mcculloch, an ardent police supporter, became a target of critics who unsuccessfully demanded he recuse himself from the mr. brown case, citing his family

acquisition of capsule rival pillpack inc. in june has turned up the heat on drugstore chains and retailers cvs health corp. and walmart inc., which dominate the prescription market.mr. kinariwala, 35, a former investment analyst, founded capsule around the idea of giving consumers real-time access to pharmacists who can provide advice and direction, while avoiding long-lines and hassles of visiting a physical drugstore.he declined to say how much revenue the company generates. the business overall is unprofitable, though it makes money on each prescription filled, he said. mr. kinariwala said operating on a national scale will hasten the company\u2019s ability to become profitable since losses are in overhead costs. to expand nationally, capsule will either build out its new york model of shipping from a warehouse, or team with a pharmacy or retail chain he said. the expansion will require building out its technology and securing licenses to distribute prescriptions in all states, a process that\u2019s under way.cvs this summer enlisted the u.s. postal service for a new home delivery service, in which the postal service would pick up prescriptions at cvs stores

to most, has received nutty amounts of cash, and a lot of buzz in the tech community. since 2011, the company has raised over $2.3 billion\u2014including funds from google and at&t \u2014on the promise of its mysterious \u201clightfield\u201d technology.and yet there\u2019s been no product, until now. starting wednesday, the company begins selling the $2,295 one creator edition.when the company invited me last month to its headquarters in plantation, fla., to test it out, i was skeptical. then i put the contraption on. i don\u2019t suggest anyone run out to buy one\u2014maybe not for years. but, oh boy, was it an inspiring glimpse at the future of our interaction with technology, and each other. i feel bad shooting the robots. on the other hand, these guys just broke through the

leap calls a \u201cphotonic chip\u201d because of all the custom electronics inside that power the special lightfield sauce. magic leap\u2019s chief executive rony abovitz spent an hour explaining the physics behind them.here\u2019s the summary: the lightwear goggles generate digital light at different depths, and send slightly different pictures to each eye, mimicking the way light from the world hits our eyeballs. unlike an ar app on a phone, which superimposes digital images onto a digital video of your surroundings, these glasses add digital objects to your view of the real world.the lightwear glasses make digital objects sometimes look so real that they play tricks on your mind. i certainly didn\u2019t think the flying robot i placed in the corner was genuine, yet the steam coming out of his jets looked like it was from a tea kettle. during one demo, i picked up an actual chess piece just to confirm it wasn\u2019t another illusion.what makes magic leap\u2019s objects so believable is how they fit into our world. cameras and other sensors in the headset scan surrounding objects and surfaces\u2014from your arms to the chair\u2019s armrest. when i placed a virtual orange fish between two actual couch pillows, it swam back and forth between them.while not as restrictive as microsoft\u2019s hololens, the lightwear has a limited field of view that constrains the experience. some objects appeared cut off unless i turned my head or took a few steps back. mr. abovitz says this will be improved in magic leap two. the fanny pack. a cable down the back of the goggles connects to a circular, hip-worn lightpack minicomputer. it has all the parts\u2014processor, memory, battery\u2014to power the headset for up to three hours on a charge.while i looked like a one-string marionette, and the pack got warm after a bit, it was certainly preferable to wearing all of those components on my face. the 0.7-pound lightwear headset is a little more than half the weight of microsoft\u2019s chunky, self-contained hololens. plus, the soft pads lining the headset make it comfortable. even after 45 minutes, i felt fine\u2014no snorkel-mask imprints or vr-like nausea. the hand-held control. while the headset\u2019s cameras allow you to use your hands to push, block and move some digital objects, the controller lets you select different apps in the main menu, move objects to different parts of the room and resize items. (oh, and shoot robots.) some apps support voice commands. there are two speakers inside the headset to add 3-d audio to the visual illusions. the web browser is as big as a classroom chalkboard. i hang it on the wall so i can come back to it later. i open a new window in the center of the room and select wayfair. i click on a red armchair and drag it into the room. i place it next to the real ottoman, walk around it to get a good look. nah, i wouldn\u2019t buy it. similar to the smartphone revolution, ar will be only as good as its apps. i found many of magic leap\u2019s technically impressive demos to be little more than a novelty.take \u201ctonandi.\u201d set to music from sigur r\u00f3s, the app sprouts neon grass that responds to the wave of my hand because\u2026 real grass has lost its luster?but seeing furniture right in my living room before i decide to hit purchase? watching the world cup in a stadium in the middle of my basement? seeing a hologram of my son as he learns to walk? sign me up.some apps magic leap has already made, or is working on with partners, do show how realistic these experiences can be. others don\u2019t exist yet\u2014hence a headset built for creators.the nba preview app, featuring that lebron james fast break, made it easy to imagine watching news, entertainment or sporting events in completely new ways. magic leap\u2019s spatial web browser will let developers share 3-d models that you can drag and drop into your own environment. when i answer an incoming call, a magic leap employee pops up in front of me, but he doesn\u2019t sit still. in fact, he paces around the room. his avatar has a luxuriant tom selleck \u2019stache, but no arms or legs. when i point that out, he seems rankled, but we still chat for a bit before he vanishes. it\u2019s easy to look at the one creator edition and see just a dorky headset, but squint a bit more and you\u2019ll see what it really is: a personal computer, similar to the apple i or the ibm pc. and like those, mr. abovitz says every generation of the headset will get smaller and more powerful.magic leap is attempting to build the computer and operating system that comes after our laptops, smartphones and tvs. it\u2019s a bold, exciting, petrifying vision of the future. while the company already faces mega competition, my experience with the one creator leaves me thinking we shouldn\u2019t count the crazy florida startup out.only developers should buy these glasses, but should you try them out? definitely. magic leap plans to launch pop-up stores and demo spaces in

initiative intended to boost public security.the split has emerged over arrest warrants, a fast-track extradition procedure introduced in the european union after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the u.s. to fight terrorism and other serious crimes.the idea was that in a bloc where physical borders have disappeared, suspects and convicted criminals shouldn\u2019t escape justice by fleeing a court\u2019s jurisdiction. it is based on the premise that all eu courts are independent and equally capable of providing suspects a fair trial.those assumptions have recently faced increased strain, with courts in ireland and greece refusing to extradite suspects to certain eu countries.a recent ruling by the european court of justice, the eu\u2019s top court, likely will complicate matters, as it allows courts to question and review the independence of judicial systems in countries requesting extraditions. the ruling followed an appeal from artur celmer, who was arrested in ireland on polish drug charges. his extradition has been delayed for a year after his lawyer argued that he wouldn\u2019t get a fair trial back home.the polish government has passed a series of judicial overhauls and forced into retirement several top judges it says were left over from the communist era, sparking eu concern that the country is removing checks on the ruling party and leading to an unprecedented eu sanctions procedure that could culminate with the suspension of poland\u2019s voting rights.the eu\u2019s top court in july said that ireland was right to delay the extradition and that it should assess whether the continuing rule-of-law dispute has a concrete impact on mr. celmer\u2019s case. the irish court this autumn could still decide to extradite mr. celmer, who faces up to 15 years in prison. mr. celmer\u2019s lawyer has said he will continue to fight his client\u2019s extradition.the european court\u2019s ruling follows criticisms of eu arrest warrants by human rights groups.\u201cmutual trust can\u2019t justify turning a blind eye to human rights violations, which unfortunately has been the case in the past with the european arrest warrant,\u201d said laure baudrihaye-gerard, a senior lawyer with the brussels office of fair trials, a criminal-justice watchdog.the group says it has documented dozens of cases of suspects extradited for minor offenses being placed in monthslong pretrial detention, often without having their charges translated to them or without access to legal and medical assistance.created to fight serious cross-border crime, european arrest warrants are mostly used for theft, fraud and drug offenses, according to eu data. of 16,144 eu warrants issued in 2015, the latest year for which data are available, only 79 were extradition requests on terrorism charges.only one-third of those extradition requests were actually executed, the european commission said in a report last year.countries can deny extradition when they don\u2019t recognize charges a suspect faces\u2014such as sedition and rebellion, the charges against carles puigdemont, the former leader of the catalan region in spain who fled to belgium in october after organizing an unauthorized referendum and declaring the independence of his region. he is fighting the charges.mr. puigdemont was arrested in germany in march on a spanish extradition request. a german court said mr. puigdemont could be extradited on a lesser charge for misuse of public funds, but not for rebellion. madrid subsequently dropped the extradition request and mr. puigdemont returned to belgium.in a separate case, greece\u2019s top court in june rejected the extradition of a russian national to malta, saying the bank-fraud charges against her were too vague. an investigative journalist killed in a car bomb in malta last year had identified the russian, maria efimova, as a source. she is contesting the charges and says her life has been threatened.ana gomes, an eu lawmaker from portugal who led a parliamentary delegation to malta following the journalist\u2019s killing, says the country should face similar sanctions as poland does over the rule of law. \u201cin malta we found the judiciary is not really working because everything is under the control of the prime minister,\u201d she said.a spokesman for the maltese prime minister rejected ms.

seller casper sleep inc. plans to open 200 of its own stores in the next three years, expanding across north america to stave off competition from dozens of internet copycats.casper ceo philip krim said the stores will help the startup move from a brand known for its mattresses-in-a-box to a place to buy all types of sleep products. \u201ccustomers aren\u2019t always in the market for a mattress, but everyone cares about how they sleep,\u201d he said.casper, which launched in 2014, opened its first permanent retail shop in new york city earlier this year. the 200 stores will include 18 existing temporary locations that casper is transitioning to permanent shops. the brand also distributes some products through target corp. , nordstrom inc. and amazon.com inc. casper is among online brands such as warby parker and everlane that have been adding brick-and-mortar stores to boost visibility and sales. as the cost to acquire customers online has risen, some online brands have been opening stores in busy locations mostly for marketing purposes.mr. krim said sales have grown more quickly in markets where the company has opened stores, including in new york, san francisco and denver. meanwhile, casper\u2019s customer acquisition costs have dropped in the past year, in part due to its openings. \u201cit\u2019s a way to educate new consumers,\u201d he said. the temporary locations have also served as a sales channel, generating on average more than $1,500 per square foot, according to casper.the openings come as many traditional retailers are shrinking their footprints and using the savings to bolster online efforts. at the end of 2017, mattress firm inc., the largest u.s. retailer of mattresses, said it would be closing around 200 of its 3,400 stores. the company recently hired advisory firm alixpartners llp to assess its real-estate portfolio, and a bankruptcy filing is one option, people familiar with the matter said.in recent years, online competitors have flooded the mattress business, and incumbents, including serta simmons bedding llc and tempur sealy international inc., now sell bed-in-a-box concepts.online purchases account for 12% to 14% of mattress sales in the u.s. and about 20% of units sold, estimates peter keith, a piper jaffray analyst who tracks the bedding industry. mr. keith said players like casper convinced customers to shop for mattresses online by compressing them into boxes that could be shipped. but many customers are now searching for cheap alternatives on amazon. on a june conference call, culp inc., a u.s. manufacturer of mattress fabric, attributed challenges in its business to the growth of chinese-imported mattresses.when it launched online, casper sold one type of mattress with free returns and a 100-day trial period. the company now sells three types of mattresses ranging from $350 to more than $1,000, as well as pillows, sheets and bed frames.mr. krim said he hasn\u2019t decided on the size and layout of the 200 stores yet. the company plans to test different models and adjust them based on feedback from customers. many of casper\u2019s temporary stores are currently in malls, and the company expects to keep opening shops in top-tier malls. the new york-based company has raised $240 million in funding from investors, including target, which invested $75 million last year. casper was valued at $920 million during its last funding round in june 2017.casper said its revenue rose 50% in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period last year. it declined to disclose revenue figures and whether it is profitable. write to khadeeja safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com", "summaryGensim": "plans to open 200 of its own stores in the next three years, expanding across

all did something that most of their peers would never even consider. they chose competitive freedom over guaranteed money. patrick reed, brooks koepka and francesco molinari are all playing without equipment sponsors this year, as is kevin na, another recent pga tour winner. they all play whichever combination of clubs they prefer, rather than only using those from a single manufacturer that pays them. there is still one more major to play\u2014the pga championship begins on thursday at bellerive in st. louis\u2014but already 2018 has become golf\u2019s year of the free agent. the flight to freedom comes at a time when the value of an equipment sponsorship is falling for all but the biggest stars\u2014making it more crucial for pros to earn money on the course.\u201cif i feel like i have the best 14 clubs in my golf bag for my game as well as the best golf ball, who knows how many shots i could save?\u201d said masters champion patrick reed. \u201cin the long run, i\u2019m going to earn more on the golf course than i am off the golf course from a manufacturer.\u201d reed won his green jacket with a ping driver, an old fairway wood from nike \u2014which doesn\u2019t even make clubs anymore\u2014and a mix of other clubs from titleist and callaway. koepka won the u.s. open with clubs from taylormade, nike, mizuno and titleist. molinari played mostly taylormade clubs at the british open, though he wasn\u2019t paid to do so.for them, the math makes sense. only a handful of marquee players command over $1 million a year on equipment deals. but 102 players made over $1 million in pga tour prize money last season. the first-place check at the pga championship alone this week is for $1.89 million.the differences between clubs from each company would seem marginal to most people. how a player performs with, say, two different 5-irons may have as much to do with their swings as the clubs\u2019 designs. but if the actual difference in distance and accuracy is tiny, so too is what separates players on the leaderboard.\u201calmost every guy out there is a tinkerer,\u201d said benjamin walter, the manager for another equipment free agent, 2013 pga champion jason dufner. \u201cthe difference between winning and top-10 is relatively small. if these guys think they can gain an edge, they\u2019re going to go that route.\u201dthe math has also changed. purse money continues to hit record highs each year, extending a boom that dates to the debut of tiger woods and survived his absence in recent years. at the same time, the market for equipment deals has cooled.agents and officials from the manufacturers say that a handful of star players\u2014think tiger woods, rory mcilroy and dustin johnson\u2014still earn several million dollars annually on such deals. but the offers for most other players have dropped substantially. a midlevel tour player who made $500,000 a decade ago might make $250,000 now.\u201cthe market has changed dramatically,\u201d said dan ladd, senior vice president of sales and marketing for cobra puma. the company, which used to sponsor several pga tour players, now sponsors only two: rickie fowler and bryson dechambeau. likewise, a spokesman for taylormade said it has reduced the number of players it endorses but declined to share specifics.\u201cit\u2019s a challenge for these athletes,\u201d ladd said. \u201cthe ones that do it are phenomenal but there seems to be fewer today that can truly cut through and be an ambassador that moves the needle for a brand.\u201dof all the equipment companies, though, the one that had the biggest impact on the market is the one that got out of it two years ago: nike. its exit not only impacted the more than 40 players it had on staff. it softened the market for everyone else. and it left players with more years remaining on their nike deals\u2014mcilroy, koepka and molinari among them\u2014in an unusual spot.according to people with knowledge of the agreements, nike continues to pay players the full value to wear its apparel. but if they sign another equipment deal, nike\u2019s financial obligation to them is significantly reduced. that diminishes the incentive for them to commit to one manufacturer.for players who have recently signed apparel-only deals with nike, that income can embolden them to remain equipment free agents. that was the case with reed when he split with callaway and signed with nike. \u201cit freed me up to give me that kind of opportunity that if i wanted to take the risk, to mix up the golf bag,\u201d reed said.most golfers don\u2019t have apparel deals lucrative enough to make equipment free agency an easy choice. in a sport where players who miss the weekend cut earn no prize money, even smaller equipment deals offer a

wrestled with the decision. \u201cyou\u2019re giving up a lot of upfront money,\u201d he said. \u201ci thought about it for a while.\u201das in other sports, being a free agent in golf can get tiresome. mcilroy was excited about his newfound freedom when nike stopped making clubs two years ago. but by winter, as he sorted through his options during an off-season testing session, he felt overwhelmed. he signed with taylormade last year.\u201cthere\u2019s too much out there,\u201d mcilroy said. \u201ci literally had 25 boxes of golf clubs in front of me. where do you go from

"the world\u2019s largest mining companies are spending big again, but it isn\u2019t on new pits or megadeals.companies including rio tinto rio 0.47% plc and glencore glncy 0.72% plc are throwing off billions of dollars to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks, making good on a pledge to increase payouts as they dig their way out of a steep market slump. yet executives have recently been forced to defend the payouts, amid worries that they are sacrificing opportunities for growth\u2014such as building mines or doing deals.\u201cwe fully acknowledge [in] the mining business you need to grow, because depletion is a reality,\u201d said rio tinto chief executive jean-s\u00e9bastien jacques. still, he said rio tinto wasn\u2019t under any immediate pressure to invest more heavily. rio tinto, the world\u2019s second-biggest miner by market value, last week said it was spending $7.2 billion on shareholder returns, including a record dividend, as it reported a 33% rise in first-half net profit. that compared with a $2.4 billion budget for big projects.iron-ore giant vale sa, after also reporting a jump in first-half underlying earnings, said it would give shareholders $2.1 billion in dividends and buy back shares worth $1 billion. vale, which recorded second-quarter capital expenditures at the lowest level in 13 years, said buying shares \u201cis one of the best investments for its excess cash.\u201dthe windfalls for investors have led mining companies to rank among the best-performing stocks globally. rio tinto\u2019s australia-listed shares have risen more than 50% over the past two years, sharply outpacing gains by the benchmark index. bhp billiton ltd.\u2019s value has jumped by two-thirds over the same period. in 2017, bhp, rio tinto, glencore, vale and anglo american plc showered investors with dividends worth over 50% more than the prior year, according to s&p global ratings. it forecasts even fatter returns in the years ahead. while payouts have risen, capital spending has dropped to $48.3 billion in 2017 from a peak of $150.1 billion in 2012, according to commodities consultancy wood mackenzie. that could fall further over the next few years if more projects aren\u2019t approved.for glencore, miners\u2019 conservatism is long overdue. the company was critical of the heavy investment made by rio tinto, bhp and others in commodities such as iron ore during the last boom because it resulted in a glut of new supply that ultimately drove down prices and industry profits. the spending spree also stretched mining-company balance sheets, forcing several midsize u.s. companies to seek bankruptcy protection.the world\u2019s 50 biggest mining companies spent about $1 trillion on projects during the last 20-year commodity cycle that started in the late 1990s, as they scrambled to feed china\u2019s industrialization and support economic growth in the u.s. and elsewhere, according to sanford c. bernstein. glencore\u2014which posted a 40% increase in adjusted net income of $3.3 billion for the first half of the year\u2014has balanced buying back shares with deals for existing assets from africa to australia. last month, the swiss-based company said it would purchase $1 billion in stock from investors. that buyback was announced days after disclosing it had received a subpoena from u.s. authorities related to compliance with corruption and money-laundering laws at its operations in the democratic republic of congo, nigeria and venezuela.glencore chief executive ivan glasenberg, one of the mining industry\u2019s biggest deal mavens, said on an earnings call wednesday that he\u2019s focused more on rewarding investors than m&a.\u201cwe don\u2019t see anything that great right now\u201d in terms of deals, mr. glasenberg said. \u201cthe best thing we can do is returning funds to shareholders and doing share buybacks.\u201dheightened regulatory scrutiny and resurgent resource nationalism have played a part in big miners exiting projects in many developing countries that management had once touted as critical to their growth. rio tinto last month signed an initial deal to sell its stake in grasberg, the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine, in indonesia.jefferies llc said the outlook is murky for aggressive expansion. an escalating conflict between the u.s. and china is threatening global trade and could stunt commodity demand if it leads to a downturn in economic growth. the firm wood mackenzie projects spending of just $23.1 billion in 2020, which would be the lowest in at least a decade.still, there are signs that some mining executives are starting to bring forward new projects, particularly focusing on metals and minerals that can feed new technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and electric cars. anglo american last month outlined plans for a giant $5 billion copper project in peru and almost doubled its first-half capital expenditures to $1.2 billion, compared with a $630 million interim dividend. rio tinto is building a bauxite pit in australia and an underground copper mine in mongolia.wood mackenzie analyst michael sinden said those investments don\u2019t go far enough. it can take five to 10 years for new mines to start up, so companies risk being unable to capitalize on any sudden rally in commodity prices. many of the world\u2019s biggest pits have been operating for decades and existing ore sources risk becoming tapped out. a supply shortfall would then pose a worrisome challenge to commodity users as higher prices mean bigger costs.

operations last november as part of president trump\u2019s strategy for ending the 17-year-old war.but the initiative hasn\u2019t had the impact military officials had hoped. so far, the air campaign has wiped out about $46 million in taliban revenue, less than a quarter of the money the u.s. estimates the insurgents get from the illegal drug trade. u.s. military officials estimate the drug trade provides the taliban with 60% of its revenue.the u.s. airstrikes have hit about 200 drug-related targets, american officials said, with nearly half of them in southern afghanistan\u2019s helmand province, an epicenter of the taliban insurgency and the heroin business. the strikes represent a small percentage of the targets hit in the intensified air campaign launched last year under mr. trump\u2019s overall strategy.over the last 17 years, the u.s. has spent more than $8.6 billion dollars trying to combat the drug industry in afghanistan. the u.s. has tried to coax opium farmers to plant legal crops such as wheat and pomegranate. it has tried to punish farmers by burning or spraying the crops with pesticides. none of the efforts has had a significant affect, according to a recent report by the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction.poppy production hit record highs in afghanistan last year, where they are the country\u2019s largest cash crop, valued at between $1.5 billion and $3 billion. afghanistan produces more than 85% of the world\u2019s illegal opium.\u201cu.s. counternarcotics activities have failed to produce lasting reductions in both cultivation and production,\u201d the watchdog agency said in its june report.u.s. military officials said their effort focuses only on the taliban use of drugs to finance the insurgency, not on combating the broader, more complex heroin industry in the region. lt. gen. jeffrey harrigian, who oversees the air war in afghanistan as head of u.s. air forces central command in doha, hoped to replicate the success the military had in crippling islamic state oil revenues in iraq and syria.over the last three years, the u.s. military said it was able to reduce islamic state oil revenue by nearly 90%. monthly revenue fell from a high of $50 million to just $4 million.\u201cit\u2019s not working as well [in afghanistan] as in syria,\u201d gen. harrigian said in an interview.in syria, the u.s. was able to repeatedly target oil processing sites used by islamic state. in afghanistan, u.s. officials said, it has been harder to identify production sites. and the military is avoiding strikes on poppy farmers who may have no firm allegiance to the taliban. instead, the strikes primarily target small compounds where afghans make, store and distribute the drugs.\u201cthis is different than what we did in iraq and syria,\u201d said gen. votel. \u201cthis, i think, presents a different targeting challenge, going after distribution and warehouses that are more easily concealed and shifted than in iraq or syria. i consider it to be a more difficult problem.\u201deven if the strikes aren\u2019t having decisive effects, u.s. officials said they are having an impact. col. jeffrey a. collins, director of counterthreat finance operations in afghanistan for the u.s. military, said the numbers don\u2019t fully account for the ways the campaign has put pressure on the taliban.\u201cthe dollar estimate of the strikes is not the primary measure we use to assess the impact,\u201d he said. \u201cwithout going into specifics, our intelligence shows our actions have impacted the taliban and its leaders in helpful ways.\u201d lt. col. martin l. o\u2019donnell, a spokesman for the u.s.-led military coalition in afghanistan, said the campaign had created new challenges for the taliban.\u201cthe taliban has had to make difficult financial decisions about what it can and can no longer afford, and it has had to conserve funds that are becoming more and more scarce,\u201d he said. \u201cas a result, the taliban has increased taxes, tolls and extortions like a crime syndicate, thereby alienating themselves further from the afghan people.\u201dthe strikes,

on the size of and counterparty to these exposures.there are some clues: loans to nonbank financial companies have been the fastest-growing element in global cross-border lending for the past two years, according to the bank for international settlements. globally, there are nearly $6 trillion of such loans and offshore financial centers received the majority. this likely covers a huge variety of business.where they definitely touch illiquid, private assets is with loans to private-equity funds that help them boost returns, loans to funds that buy up pools of secondhand stakes in private-equity funds, or loans to funds that in turn lend directly to smaller private companies. that includes u.s. business development companies, which in 2018 got legal approval to double their own borrowing. data are scarce, but anecdotal evidence suggests these kinds of exposures add up to at least $100 billion.a bigger risk is lending to exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that buy leveraged loans, the debt used to fund buyout deals. these funds take on debt worth about one-third of their asset base, according to the institute of international finance, and their investors can pull cash out at short notice. such funds potentially are very unstable in a selloff and may need to restrict redemptions.then there is the growing role in arranging and selling leveraged loans played by non-banks, such as kkr capital markets, for instance, or jefferies financial group . this is supposed to have cut financial stability risks.however, researchers at the new york federal reserve got a big surprise when they studied what happened after 2014 when big banks were told to limit leverage multiples on loans. non-banks took market share from the big banks, but almost all of the extra loan-arranging non-banks did was funded by borrowing from those big banks. it is unclear whether that was temporary borrowing or if it continued and grew.on top of this, big banks still underwrite leveraged loans and finance pools of these loans for collateralized loan obligations before they are sold. banks shift this stuff more quickly than in the past, but again hard data on their exposures are sketchy even for privileged observers such as ratings firms. but as private equity chases bigger deals and more clo managers prepare multiple issues, these exposures have surely grown.this

rosenstein, 53 years old, has had to navigate tricky political terrain. a republican, he served as u.s. attorney in heavily democratic maryland from 2005 to 2017, serving under presidents of both parties. that made him the longest-serving u.s. attorney in the country when he became deputy attorney general. mr. rosenstein prosecuted corruption cases as a member of the department\u2019s

to retire during that span.\u201cthis is one of the largest hiring cycles for airline pilots\u201d in history, said tim canoll, president of the air line pilots association, international, which represents around 60,000 pilots in the u.s. and canada.following the sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the u.s. and during the 2008 financial crisis, the aviation industry experienced a downturn and airlines consolidated. that made cockpit-crew jobs scarce and pay raises rare.in recent years, travel has picked up, but the bench of available pilots hasn\u2019t expanded enough to keep pace.some smaller airlines in the u.s. have had to scrap flights because they lack staff.\u201cthere are simply too few pilots to operate all of today\u2019s routes and with the coming wave of retirements, the situation will reach crisis levels soon,\u201d said faye malarkey black, president of the regional airline association. some of her association\u2019s members, who generally operate short-haul flights for major carriers, have had to ground flights because they can\u2019t find pilots to cover sick colleagues or to fly spare aircraft. that, she added, has led carriers to stop serving some markets. in response, airlines are now taking measures to address the problem by investing in training facilities and recruiting programs, and by offering to subsidize education costs for prospective pilots. companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to boost pay and benefits, and airlines in the u.s. and europe are luring back a generation of flight officers who had decamped to the middle east and asia.\u201cno pilot in their right mind would leave the u.s. for a job in the middle east right now,\u201d said scott stewart, 37, citing the strong u.s. labor market for pilots. mr. stewart

but cuts in the size of the armed forces have shrunk that pipeline. today, the competition for commercial pilots is so hot, the military is struggling with shortages of its own.the u.s. air force is about 2,000 pilots short, air force chief of staff gen. david goldfein told congress recently. the u.s. \u201cdoes not produce enough pilots to adequately service commercial business and military aviation,\u201d he said. that has made pilots a pricey commodity. pay for regional-airline pilots, often an entry-level position, has risen to about $50,000 a year, including bonuses, up from $30,000 in early 2016, said mr. canoll, president of the pilots union. american airlines group inc. last year lifted pilot and flight-attendant pay and benefits at a cost of $230 million in 2017 and $350 million in both 2018 and 2019. the raises follow 2016 salary increases won by pilots at delta and budget carrier southwest airlines co. the higher pay is aimed at attracting enough pilots to replace those about to retire. american said it estimates that 75% of its approximately 15,000 pilots will retire over the next 15 years.delta expects about half of its more than 14,000 pilots to reach the federal mandatory retirement age of 65 in the next decade. the airline said it plans to work with various universities to beef up recruiting as it moves to hire more than 8,000 pilots in coming years.\u201cthis is the best the industry has been in my entire career,\u201d said 20-year industry veteran bill krupp, now flying md-88 planes for delta. he recently returned to the u.s. after spending years flying in the middle east. he left to work overseas in 2005 after his u.s. airline employer went bust. united continental holdings inc. wouldn\u2019t address how many pilots were set to depart in coming years, but said it had taken steps to bolster a recruiting pipeline of new pilots from regional carriers. it added that the prospect of an eventual job with united could help its feeder carriers lure new recruits. airlines also are revamping benefits to retain staff. endeavor air, a regional arm of delta, has converted annual retention bonuses it was offering into higher base pay, providing greater security as the money won\u2019t disappear at the first sign of a downturn. psa airlines, a regional carrier owned by american airlines, has introduced a cadet scholarship program, offering to pay students as much as $5,000 to help cover the cost of becoming a pilot. it also will reimburse commuting pilots up to $3,000 a year for costs such as hotel stays.the competition for pilots is also fierce overseas. ryanair holdings plc, europe\u2019s biggest budget carrier, has tried to poach pilots from rivals. on social media, ryanair\u2019s head of talent

bearing the risk if it can\u2019t find a buyer or if prices swing. the average spot cargo leaving the u.s. is worth roughly $30 million at current prices, according to consultancy wood mackenzie.regulators have tried to push banks out of the commodities business, imposing heavy capital charges on such trades as part of the dodd-frank overhaul. two years ago, the federal reserve urged congress to revoke a special exemption that since 1999 has allowed goldman and morgan stanley to engage in a wider range of commodities activities than other banks. it warned that legal liability stemming from an oil spill, for example, could be crippling enough to endanger the entire financial system.wall street firms have pulled back in response, particularly in physical commodities, as opposed to the paper contracts that are traded alongside them. morgan stanley in 2015 sold its oil marketing and storage business, which included a fleet of tankers. goldman sold its metals-warehousing unit, and in 2014, jpmorgan chase & co. sold most of its commodities business to mercuria energy group.but goldman has deeper roots in commodities than other banks and has remained a big player in certain pockets. it is the eighth-largest marketer of natural gas in the u.s., according to data provider natural gas intelligence, and still has a uranium business called nufcor.it has been angling for a way into the lng market, which is just beginning to develop. for years, most of the world\u2019s lng was sold directly to big energy companies and utilities, which used it to generate electricity and heat.but financial firms have been edging in. four european trading houses\u2014 glencore plc, vitol group, trafigura pte ltd. and gunvor group ltd.\u2014traded roughly $10 billion worth of lng in 2017, accounting for 9% of global trade, according to wood mackenzie.these financial middlemen buy gas from producers such as cheniere and resell it at higher prices to utilities and others in developing countries in asia and africa, whose low credit ratings prevent them from inking long-term deals with suppliers. trafigura in january signed a 15-year deal with cheniere that will supply it with 1 million tons a year to trade or resell in the spot market.seeking a foothold in the business, goldman traders went looking for an lng contract late last year, people familiar with the matter said. talks with cheniere are ongoing and may not ultimately result in a signed agreement, they added. goldman could also look to buy from someone else.commodities trading holds a special place at goldman. the division still operates as j. aron, a coffee and metals trader that goldman bought in 1981. top executives including chief executive lloyd blankfein and chief financial officer martin chavez got their starts at j. aron.profits have declined across the industry and j. aron posted its worst year on record in 2017, though this year has been better. mr. chavez said recently that goldman \u201cremains committed in every way to help our clients manage their commodity risk.\u201d write to liz hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and christopher m. matthews at

however, german households have been relatively unaffected by the impact of low rates on their earnings from interest-bearing assets, according to an ecb report published wednesday, which covered the period between 2008 and 2017. that is because lower german earnings from assets such as bonds and savings accounts were almost entirely offset by lower interest payments on debt, the ecb said. french households were also relatively unaffected.in contrast, italian households experienced a large drop in interest earnings, because they were actually less indebted and held a relatively large amount of interest-bearing assets, the ecb said. the interest earnings of italian households fell by about 6 percentage points as a share of gross disposable income from 2008 to 2017, while their interest payments fell by only 2 percentage points.households in spain benefited on average from the drop in interest rates because they tend to have high levels of debt and a large share of their mortgages have adjustable interest rates, the ecb said. almost 80% of spaniards own their own home, compared with about 75% of italians and 50% of germans, according to the european union\u2019s statistics agency.the ecb\u2019s easy-money policies also affect eurozone households in other, indirect ways. by helping to stimulate borrowing and consumption, low interest rates tend to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment.the ecb said it expects private consumption to rise further as unemployment rates across the eurozone continue to fall, helping to consolidate the region\u2019s economic recovery.with economic growth stable and wages ticking up, ecb officials announced in june that they would phase out the bank\u2019s \u20ac2.5 trillion ($2.9 trillion) bond-buying program later in 2018, in a keenly-awaited move toward higher interest rates.the ecb is keeping a close eye on adverse developments in the global economy that could upset the recovery and delay any interest-rate hikes, including rising oil prices and the possibility of trade wars. still, some officials have warned that interest rates shouldn\u2019t stay so low for too long, because that could lead to excesses in financial markets and among households.so far, the ecb said it sees \u201clittle evidence that low interest rates have led to generalized increases in household indebtedness, supporting the view

impact is now being felt particularly acutely by small businesses and startups. broadly, this class of company, like others, feels good about the economy. but compared with larger operations, they have less ability to deflect higher materials prices or pass along new costs to customers. tariffs throw a wrench into pricing calculations and eat into profit margins. smaller firms also are less able to shift production to other locations and have smaller reserves to draw on when times get tough. even those that benefit from a surge in domestic business are struggling to ramp up quickly

unofficial results, mr. balderson led mr. o\u2019connor by 1,754 votes. mr. husted added there are 3,435 provisional ballots and 5,048 absentee ballots outstanding. state law forbids counting of those ballots until aug. 18. the provisional and absentee ballots could push the margin below 0.5%, which would trigger an automatic recount under ohio law.no matter the final outcome, the special

president mike pence for their campaign help. \u201camerica is on the right path and we\u2019re going to keep it going that way,\u201d he said. mr. o\u2019connor didn\u2019t concede during remarks to supporters in westerville, ohio, instead previewing that he will continue to campaign until the two candidates face each other again in the november general election, which will determine who will serve a full two-year term in congress. \u201cwe made our case for change,\u201d mr. o\u2019connor said. \u201cwe\u2019re going to make that case tomorrow. tomorrow we rest and we keep fighting through to november.\u201da green party candidate, joe manchik, received a little over 1,000 votes, which loom large given the small margin of victory. in the republican gubernatorial primary in kansas, mr. trump weighed in at the last minute with an endorsement of mr. kobach, as he did for mr. balderson, but his impact on the outcome was uncertain. it may have come too late to carry the day in a case where he was backing an antiestablishment conservative against a sitting governor.also, in missouri, a proposed right-to-work law was defeated 66% to 33%. it would have ended a requirement that private-sector workers had to join a union or pay a fee if their workplace was unionized.the results reflect a state of flux in u.s. politics since the election of mr. trump, a former television personality and real-estate developer who was a newcomer to politics when he won the presidential campaign in 2016.mr. trump has engaged in the midterm congressional elections, particularly republican primaries, in ways most presidents have resisted in recent years and his actions appear to have energized activists in both political parties. republicans sought to nationalize the ohio race in its closing weeks. although mr. balderson was a tepid fundraiser, outside gop groups spent more than $4 million attacking mr. o\u2019connor as a clone of house democratic leader nancy pelosi while mr. trump and mr. pence both visited the district with mr. balderson in the final week of race.republicans had held the ohio seat uninterrupted since 1983, which was open following the resignation of gop rep. pat tiberi. he served in it for 18 years before resigning in january to lead a local business organization.corry bliss, the executive director of the house gop super pac congressional leadership fund, warned that other republicans on the ballot this november should do a better job raising money than did mr. balderson. mr. o\u2019connor, a family-law attorney who is in his first term as franklin county recorder, sought to keep his distance from mrs. pelosi, calling for \u201ca new generation of leadership\u201d in congress.but the 31-year-old fumbled a question about a speaker vote during an msnbc interview last month, saying he would back \u201cthe democratic candidate\u201d in a close vote, even if it meant voting for mrs. pelosi. he subsequently reiterated that he wouldn\u2019t back her.while mr. balderson led every pre-election public poll that included all of the candidates on the ballot, republicans in recent weeks grew concerned he would lose. a visit by mr. trump on saturday night was intended to motivate a local party base that appeared uninterested in the race.mr. balderson, a 56-year-old state senator, said monday night in his hometown of zanesville that while mr. trump brought energy to the campaign, his aim was to make the contest about the district and not the national political mood.\u201cthis has gained so much national attention, and we didn\u2019t want that,\u201d he said. \u201cwe were trying to keep the national media out of it.\u201din other races, gretchen whitmer, formerly the democratic leader in the michigan state

of sen. bernie sanders (i., vt.) and alexandria ocasio-cortez, whose upset primary victory against rep. joe crowley (d., n.y.) has propelled her to national recognition.attorney general bill schuette

couldn't hear. some of those discussions involved confidential business information that couldn\u2019t be revealed in public, and the transcripts show judge leon was concerned about sensitive corporate data being revealed by accident.but they also show that many of the discussions didn\u2019t involve confidential information, including most of the judge\u2019s rulings on what types of

cord-cutting and competition from streaming giants such as netflix inc., mr. iger, on a conference call with wall street analysts tuesday, focused on disney\u2019s high-stakes plan to fight back: the company\u2019s own direct-to-consumer offerings and a pending $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st century fox inc.\u2019s fox 0.92% entertainment assets. \u201cconsumers are picking and choosing from all of the options in the market,\u201d said mr. iger, in remarks after disney\u2019s release of quarterly financial results. \u201cwe continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy.\u201dmr. iger has reorganized his company and is spending heavily to implement that strategy. in the three months since his previous earnings call, mr. iger won a bidding war with comcast corp. cmcsa 1.10% for the fox assets, which include the company\u2019s film and television studios, as well as media company star india and the sky plc pay-television operator. the deal has already been approved by u.s. authorities at the justice department but still needs clearance from several foreign jurisdictions. if the deal closes, as disney says it expects it to next year, it will put the company responsible for \u201cavatar\u201d and \u201cthe simpsons\u201d under the same roof as mickey mouse, luke skywalker and \u201cthe avengers.\u201d those brands will then be used to sell consumers on a disney-branded streaming service set to launch in late 2019. mr. iger\u2019s hope is that the strength of disney\u2019s brand and characters will allow it to compete in a crowded streaming market and \u201cthrive alongside netflix, amazon and anyone else,\u201d he said. the focus on direct-to-consumer offerings will suddenly put disney, a company best known for traditional film and television entertainment, in charge of three separate digital services. the company\u2019s espn plus sports-programming streaming service was launched earlier this year, and disney will become a majority owner of hulu if the fox deal closes. hulu is a joint venture among disney, fox and comcast\u2019s nbcuniversal. \u201cthey will basically be designed to attract different tastes or different audience demographics,\u201d said mr. iger, referring to the three different services. the company might bundle the subscriptions for customers who want all three, he added. disney\u2019s streaming service, featuring programming that includes \u201cstar wars\u201d and \u201chigh school musical,\u201d will have fewer titles than an \u201caggregation\u201d service like netflix, he said, and will instead rely on consumers\u2019 perceived demand for the company\u2019s franchises. the disney service \u201cdoes not to have to have close to the volume of what netflix has because of the value of the brands,\u201d mr. iger said. it remains unclear how exactly fox\u2019s film and television assets will fit under the disney roof, but mr. iger nodded to some plans on the call tuesday. the company\u2019s fox searchlight label, responsible for recent best-picture winners such as \u201c12 years a slave\u201d and \u201cthe shape of water,\u201d will likely produce for streaming services with original film and television projects, he said. fox\u2019s film studio will continue work on existing series, he said, including planned sequels to \u201cavatar,\u201d \u201cthe fantastic four\u201d and \u201cx-men.\u201d mr. iger indicated that such films will remain traditional theatrical releases, rather than be produced for streaming-service distribution. the company said certain expenses for its third fiscal quarter almost doubled from the same period a year earlier to $196 million. that increase stemmed partly from its agreements to buy the 21st century fox assets, as well as higher compensation costs, disney said.21st century fox and news corp , parent company of the wall street journal, share common ownership.control of sky remains an open question for disney. comcast is still angling for control of the european pay-tv operator, and currently has the lead with a bid that values sky at $34 billion, or about 5% higher than fox\u2019s most recent offer. another round of offers would come from fox, but disney has the right to veto any deal and effectively end the standoff because it would acquire the sky stake when its deal closes. on tuesday, fox posted its sky offer document, satisfying a requirement under u.k. takeover rules and giving it more time to respond to comcast\u2019s higher offer.mr. iger indicated tuesday that he wanted to win sky, citing it as one of the fox international assets that fit into disney\u2019s \u201cglobal growth strategy.\u201din the third quarter, disney posted year-over-year increases in net income and revenue, if not to the extent that most wall street analysts expected. revenue climbed 7% to $15.2 billion and net income rose 23% to $2.9 billion. revenue was driven by a 20% increase in the company\u2019s studio-entertainment division. disney\u2019s \u201cthe incredibles 2\u201d set a box-office record during the quarter, becoming the top-grossing animated film to date with nearly $600 million in the u.s. and canada. another major release for the quarter, \u201cavengers: infinity war,\u201d has collected more than $2 billion world-wide. disney\u2019s film arm had a rare misstep

bulk of the spending will be earmarked for samsung electronics co. , the conglomerate\u2019s crown jewel. the company is the world\u2019s no. 1 maker of smartphones, semiconductors and televisions and last year put more toward capital expenditures than any other publicly traded company,samsung \ufeffsaid it would invest heavily in four key areas through 2020. auto tech, artificial intelligence and new fifth-generation, or 5g, cellular technology\u2014all of which that fall under samsung\u2019s umbrella\u2014will draw funding, as will its nascent drug companies specializing in contract manufacturing and biosimilar medications.samsung, south korea\u2019s largest business empire, spans 62 affiliates as diverse as life insurance and theme parks. it didn\u2019t provide a specific breakdown of the new investments, but the spending represents samsung\u2019s broadest investment in new business pursuits since 2010.when combined with previously announced investments, the company will spend 180 trillion won, or about $161 billion, over the three-year period, a total that includes commitments for semiconductors and displays. roughly $100 billion will go to capital expenditures, according to s&p global market intelligence estimates. lee jae-yong, samsung\u2019s de facto leader, has made innovation a priority across the conglomerate, according to people familiar with the matter. in october, samsung electronics chairman kwon oh-hyun said the firm was facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d and was \u201chard-pressed to find new growth areas right now.\u201d the company replaced all three of its ceos in march. samsung lacked bold moves last year, as the conglomerate dealt with a leadership vacuum after mr. lee was jailed during a high-profile corruption probe. he was released on a suspended sentence in february and has appealed his case to the supreme court. on monday mr. lee made his first public appearance in south korea since leaving jail, meeting with the country\u2019s finance minister at a samsung semiconductor facility in pyeongtaek, about 40 miles south of seoul. during the visit, finance minister kim dong-yeon called samsung\u2019s role in helping reshape the economy important. the country\u2019s left-learning president, moon jae-in, has made job creation a priority, especially for the underemployed youth, saying the situation could become a national disaster if unaddressed. the conglomerate\u2019s investments will directly create 40,000 jobs over the next three years, samsung said. the south korean firm\u2019s focus on auto tech has accelerated after it announced in late 2016 an $8 billion deal to buy harman international industries inc., the company\u2019s largest-ever acquisition. it also launched a $300 million auto-tech investment fund last year. samsung has also been building up its ai capabilities aggressively, opening new research centers in cambridge, u.k., toronto and moscow in may. the company plans to build an internal team of at least 1,000 ai-dedicated engineers and researchers by 2020, with new hires and worker reassignments. by that year, samsung wants to put ai features and internet connectivity into all its products. samsung last announced significant conglomerate-wide investment plans for new businesses in 2010, committing more than $20 billion over a decade to develop technologies in fields such as medical devices, rechargeable batteries for electric cars and the initial bet on biopharmaceuticals. write to timothy w. martin at timothy.martin@wsj.com", "summaryGensim": "the samsung
